Many of you probably have many questions going into JC soon and I'd be more than happy to address them. This is an open invitation to AMA or have a conversation, preferably through DMs.

I am a J2 in RJC this year and also involved in Orientation 2021, so i'd especially welcome any rjc ama. but dont expect me to spoil too much HAHAHA i will only provide necessary information and things that are okay for yall to know :>",capnux,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

2,t3_f4q37z,"Currently a 4E student taking O's this year. Been eyeing Singapore Polytechnic's Creative Writing for Digital TV and New Media (DTVM) course since around November/December last year. Today, decided to do a little bit more in-depth research on it, through online blogs, Reddit threads and Youtube videos. After gathering more information, I'm now determined to get into the course and would like to try to enter through the EAE process. However, I have a few concerns that sparked because of what I've read and heard from other sources. 

I think it's also important to state that I have quite a bit of experience in the field of Creative Writing (7 published short stories in local newspaper + SOTA Creative Writing Competition 2016 Finalist) and that I am also Malaysian (been studying in Singapore since Primary 1) and have been interested in writing since young.

My first concern is that I am not in a CCA that really has any sort of the link to the course. I am from Robotics Club, and from what I have seen when researching, many of those who applied via EAE were either from Drama Club, Photography Club, Debate Club etc. Thus, I am quite worried they would ask me why I did not decide to join one of the above CCAs if I knew what I wanted to do from young. Additionally, they may ask why I did not decide to go for an Engineering course instead.

My second concern is that what I have in my portfolio is not enough to truly express my passion for writing and my determination to get into the course. Although I have 7 published short stories in my local newspaper, I have a feeling that they might just dismiss this achievement since the newspaper is a Malaysian one. Not sure if this is just me overthinking or if it's going to be a real problem. Other than that, I also have a certificate and an offer letter from SOTA (School of The Arts Singapore) from their 2016 Creative Writing Competition, and several debate certificates. Not sure if these help boost me up or not.

My third concern is about the interview. Heard that DTVM mostly holds group interviews and I'm afraid I'll be drowned out by the voices of the other interviewees. Not sure if the interview is turn-based, giving everyone a chance to speak, or if it's just a fight between the interviewees to have their voice heard.

My fourth concern is what I'll be learning in the course. Did a thorough readup on the different modules that are part of the course and can't lie, they really grabbed my attention. They seem quite interesting and I think they will help hone my writing skills as well. However, read a blogpost that it's impossible to obtain a GPA of 4.0 in the course. I'm going to be honest, as I'm writing this, I only know that GPA is like a sort of overall grade of a student, but I'm not sure how it affects you completely. In fact, this low probability of obtaining a GPA 4.0 actually made the author of the blogpost transfer to JC from DTVM (which terrifies me)

My final concern is that I would not be able to cope with the workload in the course. Heard that Polytechnic timetables are quite flexible and that class timings constantly change. However, this might actually be a problem for me since I still live in Malaysia and would probably still have to wake up the same time to get to school (3.45am) Not sure if this ""flexibility"" would help or take a toll on me, but heard that MAD courses have quite long school hours so that has me worried. To add on, I am aware that JC has a fixed timing for school everyday, but I do not like the idea of JC. Heard that it's similar to another 2 years of Secondary School, and I can't see myself doing this ""sit-in-a-classroom-and-listen-to-your-teacher-ramble-about-concepts-while-occasionally-dozing-off"" thing anymore. Also, read that CCAs in Poly last up until 9+ and that is a major red flag for me, because that would mean me reaching home at 11+ (I would still like to join a CCA though)

Not really a concern but also a concern (?) : Do Malaysians get lower priority for EAE?

So that's all that I'm really worried about. I still have about 3 and a half months before the EAE process starts in June, but I just decided to start thinking about what I really wanted to do in the future since almost everyone else is talking about it. The only topic in Secondary 4 is just ""Where do you want to go after Secondary education?"" So, yeah. If any Poly seniors could leave some comments that would be great. If any Poly seniors who EAE'd into DTVM could leave some comments that would be awesome, too. Thank you for your time!",rejectedonce,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

17,t3_cfngp7,"I'm feeling really stressed about JC life after I received my MYE results. Actually I have been very stressed out about JC life at the end of Term 1 after I had beef with one of my classmates over  a petty situation. The thing is I feel that most of my classmates dislike me for being so different from them and for being a mugger when that's the point of JC in the first place. As a result, I have no one to turn to apart from my sole friend in the class. To make things worse, I had to be in the same pw group as the classmate whom I had beef with, and I disliked her very much as she was extremely petty and accused me of doing things that I did not do at all. And to make matters worse, my former group of friends excluded me from their group after they befriended another one of my classmates, which caused me to become a loner. That was also another reason why I chose to enter the mugging lifestyle just to get rid of all the misery that I am facing at school. Sadly, I can conclude that my efforts did not pay off despite my consistent efforts to do well for MYE. Here are my results:

2. H2 Economics - B
3. H2 Literature - E

18,t3_i2v4tk,"Hey there!

So, I have created a suggested answer for the H2 History (9752) topic of **Rise of Asian Tigers**. The essay question is as follows:

# [To what extent was South Koreaâ€™s miraculous economic ascent from the 1970s a result of its own efforts?](http://thediscourse.sg/h2-history-notes/essay-and-sbq-answers/korea-miraculous-ascent/)

**Click the link above for the FULL essay**. 

*Don't worry, there are ads on the website, but it doesn't phish or anything like that. Also, the ads are wholesome and proper ones.* 

So, just a couple of tips before we continue.

# Question Breakdown

**Subject Matter**: South Korea/Republic of Korea (ROK)

**Key terms and their definitions**:   
\- miraculous economic ascent: Rapid economic growth. Nothing much else to see here.  
\- a result of its own efforts: The aforementioned ascent *is attributed to only internal factors such as the role of private businesses, culture, and government policies.*

**Tackling the question**:  
\- You need to reject this question by suggesting that it was NOT only due to internal factors...  
\- ...But agree with it to the extent that internal factors (i.e. its own efforts) were FOUNDATIONAL to their rapid economic growth.

# Some Tips

Not a technically difficult essay, but the issue is that this topic, like the other Theme 2s of either International or SEA History, requires a tricky bit of you guys having to *explain the effects of economic policies/events on certain economies* without lapsing into economic jargon. In short, you need to write it in a layperson manner. 

Also, in tackling this question, you need to address *how the factors interacted with each other*. It isn't enough to say, ""Yes, internal factors > external ones mmmhmmmm ezpz chicken dinner.""

Further difficulties are found in the content itself. How do we know *what* examples to use for this w.r.t. government policies? [How do we remember the content](http://thediscourse.sg/education/how-to-memorise-a-levels-content/)? Etc. Unfortunately, I won't cover the conceptual framework for this topic, but please feel free to slide into my DMs to ask questions. (If ""slide into my DMs"" is even still a thing. I'm old.)

# Essay Outline (Topic Sentences)

1. Indeed, it could be argued that South Koreaâ€™s miraculous economic ascent  be attributed to its own efforts through businesses that drove economic  growth.
2. In addition, more of South Koreaâ€™s efforts could be found in its inherent Confucian culture, which translated to a strong work ethic that ensured productivity in the economy.
3. However, to suggest that South Koreaâ€™s economic ascent was down solely  to its own efforts would grossly misrepresent the aforementioned ascent,  as external factors like US aid and the Cold War geopolitical context did contribute to South Koreaâ€™s economic growth.
4. Nevertheless, in spite of how South Koreaâ€™s economic ascent cannot be  solely attributed to its own efforts alone, this essay will still assert  that its own efforts proved foundational for its unprecedented economic  growth through directed government policies.
5. Additionally, astute government policies harnessed the aforementioned  roles of businesses, culture, and external aid to ensure its economic  ascent, which once again affirms how South Koreaâ€™s own efforts proved  foundational albeit it cannot receive sole credit.

Conclude.

The idea, simply put, is to point out how it cannot be down to its efforts alone. BUT! Think of the interaction between internal factors like a layer cake. Bizs drive the growth, underpinned by strong work ethic, of which the government made use of through its policies. 

I hope this helps. If you guys need more quick essay outlines, please let me know and I'll write them accordingly. Also, do check out my other essays on my website if it so interests you!

20,t3_ksjad2,"Hi, so you might know me from the O levels result release post and I feel like talking about this today because some of my friends suffered during this period. So a bit of background, I was from YIJC and graduated in 2019 with double cca, took PCMe.

Term 1-2:

* Focused on events(orientation, SYF, A divs, event planning, etc), may see grades fall which is normal, esp since H2 Math ahs vectors, H2 Chem has org chem and transition elements and H2 econs has gloabalisation and macro econs. Here is some advice I would give:

1. Buy a planner for time management and write down hw due dates, events and goals you can set on the planner. Try not to make it too rigid and adjust accordingly to changes.(e.g in case got wedding, hospital etc.) 

2. Revise J1 topics as early as you can. For GP, start memorising content ans examples. Try to take about 1h to look thru J1 topics.(For now, I guess maybe just looking thru the notes and relooking at corrections and tys, maybe even additional qns too, mostly for H2 physics and Chem in YIJC). Oh and btw, yes, it is normal to start doing Math Yearly TYS at Term 2 since most would have finished 90% of syllabus by then.

3. Start reading J2 topics before lecture. It could be on the way to school too. And even if your lecture sucks, pls dont skip lecture. Rather, do your tutorials while the lecture is going on. And do ask your tutor for any doubts durig tutorials. Always do hw.

4. CCA is important so please don't skip them unless you are sick or any valid reason. Plus they can be good for portfolio(scholarships, competitive courses and jobs) Never miss out. For events like CNY and CCA farewell, pls try not to lose out on them, especially if they involve bonding as it is your last year in JC before studying hard core for A levels. And also please never use CCA as an excuse for those doing coursework e.g. H2 Art, Music and China Studies.

5. Be healthy and exercise. For those dieting for A divs, please at least eat a light meal in school. And do try to exercise, especially for the guys who are going to do IPPT. And if you want to, go for flu vaccinations especially sicne you need to study across flu season as well.

6. Please spend June holidays wisely. I have seen people using June holidays as if it was a time to party and play Mario Kart. But be aware that you have 4 to 5 mnths at this pt for A levels in Oct and Nov.

7. PLEASE pay attention to practicals as this is the only chance that you will be using the lab. Pay attention to what to write and how to do things.

Term 3-4:

*At this point, whatever you do during this limited time will affect your A levels. No CCA but you may be called back to do CCA stuff sometimes, especially those with Exco positions. Social life may be affected and reduced but there are other who will COMPLETELY ignore the situation. 

1. For those studying at home, find a conducive space to study. It can be outside the corridors or downstairs. Please NEVER study on bed as you may be more inclined to sleep when studying. If you feel like the house is super noisy, try using earphones or earplugs if it works. Else, maybe a sleepover at someone's house may work. 

2. Addicted gamers may be affected so please do not attempt to download any NEW games.(There was a time when Mario Kart came out on Sept which was prelim period. At that time it made me realised how addicted I was.) If need to, uninstall the phone. But promise me when ai say this. NEVER NOT USE YOUR PHONE. Teachers are becoming more inclined to use technology to make things easier, especially for homework and communications so please NEVER remove your phone or at least use a seperate phone for studying purposes.

3. Should I bring an Ipad or laptop to school? Not necessarily. You can print documents out. If you are reading notes from there, it is ok. But do try to find a way to print them out to prevent anyone from losing any devices. (Again, I said not necessary but you can still bring them if you are doing hw from there and if you feel that you study effectively from there.)

4. REDUCE but NOT ELIMINATE social life. If your CCA is doing something like alumni stuff AND you can still handle studies(maybe a B), then do it. Do try to meet friends once every 2 weeks and if possible, you can make study groups(unless they disturb you a lot then nvm.) And do note that with graduation, please do not ignore this occasion as this would be your last chance to be with the people you love.

5. At Term 3 and 4, I have to warn you that you should be doing practice papers at this time. And not just DO practice papers, but also under TIMED condition. Try to set a day called ""Study notes day"" where you scan through the notes and recall from your notes to see which topics are you still horrible at. In my JC, they do give timetrials after term 4 so do try to attempt timetrials given by the JC. Also do try to study/read up your notes first before attempting the paper. And at this point, do your yearly TYS or prelim papers.

6. In terms of school,(may or may not work) if you want to adjust the timetable, try to.(Idk how to explain this but I use my experience. So during Chem class, we asked the teacher whether we could bring our chem slot(arnd 2-3pm) to lunch period(10-11am). With agreement especially from the Muslim guys in our class, our class ended on 12.30 on fridays instead of 3pm.(MAY OR MAY NOT WORK). Also for consultations, do book them IN ADVANCE and PREPARE for the consultations as tutors still have the authority to decline a consultation if you do not prepare anything. If you dont know what to prep, create qns that you can ask the tutor.(Why am I not allowed to say ""XXX""? Can I write it in another way? I don't udnerstand why I cannot say ""XXX"", Is my working wrong? So far I know how to do this working but I dont know where to continue on from there. Am I allowed to use this format? etc). If you feel that you think ""your tutor is useless""(not saying they are), my opinion is just try out first. And if that still does not work, try consulting another tutor and consult with a friend under that tutor. It can be useful. If not, try asking a ""smart"" friend for help as well.

7. Do try to study for practical for H2 Science students as they contribute 20% of the score.

8. Find out what is your study method. Do not insult other people methods of studying as not everyone has the same studying style and environment. 

Few days before A levels:

1. At this point this is where I recommend compiling your corrections as you can reread the corrections again and understand what went wrong. Please do not attempt too much prelim papers without marking. 

2. Eat healthily, to prevent yourself from an upset stomach. Exercise but dont overexercise, to prevent strains or cramps or dislocation from affecting you.

3. Figure out what topics you are missing or weak at and cover the gaps. Read through your notes again(There was one time I reread my Physics notes in which I realised a topic that I did not study (Momentum of Photon calculation.) Luckily studied it and it came out during physics application question about gravitational holes lol. 

4. Identify which resources are missing that your require. French curve? Ruler? Graphing calculator? E dictionary? Most important, do try to print out your entry proof(NOT THE RECEIPT) as this can help you be able to find the stuff you need(unless you rather buy a $1 copy from GO). Most importantly ensure that you have entry proof, NRIC and FILLED PENS(looking at you humanities papers and GP.)

5. Know when your papers occur and for those having scholarships, check out whether APPLICATION DUE DATE occurs before end of A levels.(SUTD early admission.)

During A levels:

1. Come to school early and know your exam venue. At least an hour. Dry and calm yourself. Please do not dye your hair. And turn mobile to silent. Ensure all pockets(esp jacket) do not contain any information relevant to exam. Tissues are fine. Do bring a jacket due to air con. And most importanly, listen to the instructions of the invigilator. 

2. In any case that something makes you uncomfortable or fearful (e.g. calculator spoil, nose bleed, water spillage.) Do inform the invigilator as immediately as possible. They are there to at least ensure things are fair. Don't be nervous when asking for fulscap immediately.

3. Never give up. I have seen a student sleep during exam before he gave up on H2 Math. That should not mean you should give up. EVEN IF you screwed up a previous relevant paper, it could be a minor mistake which makes you lose a few marks. Esp for GP for essay  and Math which require working. Never lose because of a mistake you made. 

4. Eat something that does not cause gastric pains in stomach. I recommend water and a sandwich or at least something for morning papers.

That is all I have to say about A levels for J2s. I wish you all the best and hope that covid does not affect how you study.

To get to the point, I have no friends. ðŸ˜¶  I have a few acquaintances from CCA, I have lunch with them once every 2 months (maybe even 3 lol), barely talk about personal life/interests. No, the problem is  I actually don't even know what their interests are >\_<. But yea we also don't talk outside of school, the most is they ask me about studies.

Of course I have acquaintances from my own class, but same story, except I don't ever have lunch with them (actually once but it was because we had to do projects so no choice so I count it as 0ðŸ˜œ). Yes no one text me after school, unless they want to copy homeworkðŸ˜’. Yes I'm seen as the model student for some reasons that I do not know of.

I feel like very little have similar interests as me (I like MATH! Books are very nice too. Playing guitar on-off for 5 yearsðŸ¤­) but yea seen many people liking pop music, chase the latest trends, fashion etc etc, so many jokes I don't seem to understand ðŸ˜¶. But, I have 0 interests in those stuff, I don't even use instagram, Tik Tok, etc etc social media. The only ones I use are like WhatsApp (ofc because school and stuff), YouTube (who doesn't) and well, reddit (but rarely for leisure content??). So yeap I'm basically very outdated and living under my textbooks, but I'm too lazy to do anything about it because relationships and stuff is troublesome to me anyways. 

So I would like to know, should I actually care? Right now I really don't, I really enjoy everything by myself, I don't get jealous or envious when I see others with friends. I know this sounds kinda selfish, but I was wondering if it would be bad if I don't have friends in the future, as in no one is there to help me when I need it (except family ðŸ¥°), since parents and teachers have always said its easier with friends to help each other.

Hi, I am an Alevel graduate and iâ€™m interested in applying for NTU ADM and Lasalle for their animation course. 

Short info about myself:

- did not take Art as a subject for A and O levels but i do enjoy drawing in the free time

- IGP of ABB/C with B in GP and A in PW and olevel HMTL 

- portfolio now consists of some digital illustrations, 2 acrylic paintings, 1 water color painting and a clay model

However, I feel as though my portfolio isnâ€™t as great as I would like it to be and it is not as developed with no coursework boards like they do for Alevel Art

I have also read that there is only around 150 (139 last year) intakes a year and after considering all the art students and poly students with foundation skills, it seems as though i donâ€™t stand a chance in it. 

My other option is Lasalle but I am also unsure if i will be able to make it, and I would prefer to go to NTU rather than Lasalle

Also, I have applied and gotten accepted to 3dsense media school but I would much rather go to NTU firstly because it is cheaper as compared to the overseas degree pathway offered by 3dsense, and also I would prefer a degree from NTU for practical future purposes. Also, my parents reluctantly allowed me to apply for 3dsense and I could sense from them that they *much* rather i go to a local Uni. 

I hope that there would be seniors in ADM who were from a similar background to share with me their experiences for the uni application and also give me some advice to increase my chances of getting in!",mischiefstarks,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0

32,t3_t37sj0,"I just received my A level results, after months of crying and worry. I am here to provide some advice to J2 students taking A levels this year.

As an introduction, I was always consistent in my work (doing TYS and exam papers even before the topics were taught). However, the problem was that I started chionging too early (Jan) and eventually burned out near to the A levels. I started having problems focusing in exams, where questions read all flew above my head, not understanding anything at all.

So A levels came and the same problem happened, making me super anxious. It did not help that I was stupid enough to immediately scroll through Reddit megathreads after each exam taken. I cried after every paper, recounting the number of marks I lost for hours instead of mugging for the next exam. Of course it affected my next few examinations.

However, fortunately enough I managed to score reasonably well, making my months of worry look p dumb (lol).

I really don't want anyone to face the same problems as I did and thus my advice to J2s this year:

1. Please manage your pace in mugging. quantity=/=quality. Studying hard MIGHT work for some but it can definitely cause disastrous outcomes during the exam that really matters should you burn out
2. DO NOT check the reddit megathread nor look at answers of the exam papers in the midst of examinations EVEN IF you think you did well. You might have made a few careless mistakes that might cause you to freak out for the next few papers (ignorance is bliss).
3. Do more prelim papers rather than redoing TYS multiple times. Redoing questions you are familiar with might cause you to be falsely confident in the subject and eventually stunned when new questions types are asked (especially when recent years' papers have been really whack and application-driven) Also time yourself when practicing papers
4. Be there for each other in your class, it definitely feels better if everyone scores well compared to only you scoring well (imo)

All the best for your studies and hope you guys enjoy your time learning!!",tenthousandyeehaws,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

Error in A-level chemistry exam paper: Some students got extra time, some did not

It resulted in students finishing the exam at different times. PHOTO: LIANHE ZAOBAO
SINGAPORE â€“ An error in the A-level chemistry exam on Wednesday morning was dealt with differently across schools, resulting in students finishing the exam at different times.

A question in the third paper of the H2 Chemistry exam showed a bond between two elements drawn incorrectly in one of the diagrams.

Three students who spoke to The Straits Times but asked not to be identified said candidates at some schools were given extra time to make up for the time spent by invigilators explaining the error, while at other schools, they were not.

ST understands that at Nanyang Junior College, an errata slip was circulated to students before the paper began. The slip pointed out that atomic bonds had been drawn wrongly in three chemical structures.

The exam, which was scheduled for two hours between 8am and 10am, ended at 10.06am as the students were given an extra five minutes to check their papers.

However, at Hwa Chong Institution, students were not given extra time. An errata paper was given to them with their papers before the exam started for them to read, and the exam took place as planned, from 8am to 10am.

The error and the differences in how schools dealt with it was discussed on the website Reddit.

Some posters said it was unfair to students who did not get extra time. Some said the disruption caused by the error affected their focus.

The error was in Question 5, an optional question, so students could have chosen to do another one instead.

ST has contacted the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board for comment.",Shagua85,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Recently, a few students feedback that they are unable to do papers at home in a disciplined manner due to factors such as distractions and inconducive studying environment. I suggested going to the library but there are other issues such as lack of space.

I am thinking of opening up an exam venue (with air-con and individual desks). Students pay a fee, enter the venue at a designated time, and an exam paper (I will design a paper, as close to the actual exam standard as possible) will be given, and the students will be timed. There will also be an invigilator.

Some students told me that itâ€™ll benefit them due to the lack of mid year exams in school.

The papers will then be marked, and the marked papers, along with a score, feedback and answers, will be mailed the to the studentâ€™s residential address.

Will students be interested in such a service? Would like to find out! Thanks! Other feedback are welcomed too (e.g. the room should be available for use after the paper for self study, there should be paper debrief after the paper etc.)

Disclaimer: I only ask to try to benefit as many students as possible (if such a service is even beneficial). Not trying to advertise.

first of all, this wasnt the first offence he did involving girls/women in school and he gets let off more than TWICE??

2, same group constantly harrassing a good friend of mine. lets call him Q for easy recognition. Q was my good friend throughout the preperation for N and O levels (study nights, class revisions, etc.) 

i was sad to hear that his A math caused him to not get into pfp. he scored pretty well too. he wasnt allowed to go to ite because of his parents. everyday after school, he has to go home straight to do daily chores and pick up his younger sister from school. the most ridiculous thing is, Q's parents CHARGE HIM FOR EVERY STRAND OF HAIR THEY FIND. Q BARELY HAS TIME TO STUDY BECAUSE OF HOW MUCH STRESS HIS PARENTS PUT HIM THROUGH. it has come to the point where Q's hair is dropping due to overwhelming amount of stress. whats also infuriating is that THAT group of friends call him ""baldy"" in school. at this point, i feel like avenging Q because he was my comfort friend.

the group i am referring to isnt just 2 or 3 people, im talking about roughly 5-8 or more. i really wish i could give Q a hug.

3, same group again. next one too. lets call him K. K, who got straight 1s for both N and O level subjects and now studying in poly for engineering, was also made fun of by the same guys. it was during moments where they were having kahoot, menti or blooket. they would make fun of him through the nickname system. he wasnt all too bothered by it but i was. K and I werent that close but we consider each other as good friends.

4, another friend, well we kinda drifted but i consider good people i know there friends. there arent many, but they deserve the title. she wanted to go to JC hence stayed back for sec 5. they would say R word jokes about her back in sec 4 and still do so now. i dont understand WHY THEY ARE SO FUCKING SICK IN THE HEAD. i personally never experienced R jokes towards me, BUT I WISH I COULD JUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

i cannot help but to feel bad for the my friends. the entire upper sec experience with that exact same cohort is HELL i dare say. i am grateful to leave sec sch at sec 4 but i cannot say the same to the friends who wish to pursue life in JC or has no choice.

i think thats all the frustration i would like to let out in this post.. feel free to leave your opinions about this. i am really sick to the stomach knowing people like them exist in this society.

I've emailed the international admissions team of the school I'm looking at, and their reply was vague but it did say that I can check back after the 18 May decision deadline to see if any places become available. But I'm wondering what are my chances of being able to apply to a course of my choice with UCAS Extra, which opens up later this month? The course I'm looking at is really competitive, and I really should have applied earlier, but I was busy with my final sem internship and sch assignments (although I know it's not an excuse, I should have been more responsible).

Are my chances low? Should I prepare more backup options outside of UK?

I'm considering triple science because I like it (especially bio) and I'm trying to pursue a career in medicine in the future. Initially, I wanted to do double sciences and Elect His + Art because I was really good at art and loved it until my art grades dropped because I was going through a tough time and couldn't cope with my poor mental health.

It sounds bad to drop something I love just because I didn't do well once, but there are also other reasons. I knew doing art next year could be bad for me because I am very afraid of failure (I would tear my artworks and redo them in my sketchbook), and I will burn out easily. I don't want to end up hating art in the process.

For now, I want to do triple science and elect his (I dislike lit and geog and history is so-so. I do well in all my humans.) but I'm still not sure if I will regret it.

What are your thoughts? and in your opinion, is triple science difficult?

63,t3_j5jvq6,"Hello!

I have approximately two weeks to jump two grades, in order to meet the minimum requirements of the course I EAE'd into, which requires a D7 in Math, and depending on whether the bell curve is on my side or not, that's a low to mid 40. Seems easy enough, right? 

I'm currently at an F9, according to my Prelim results, and I have been in that range for quite some time now, with some exceptions, though. So, if the cutoff for D7 is say, 45 or so, I have to wring out fifteen marks worth of knowledge out of my TYS in thirteen days. 

Is a two grade jump in two weeks feasible, or should I get to preparing appeal letters? 

Could someone give me a brief rundown on what topics I should capitalise on, to maximise my chances of seizing that borderline fail grade? It sounds pathetic, but that's just where I'm at right now.

67,t3_10cmdul,"just a little warning, this post is gonna be long and might be a little messy because i honestly donâ€™t know how to organise it so that it flows nicely, i kinda just typed whatever came to mind. also i know there's a million posts like this but i'm posting this because i still can't really get the answers i need from reading their comments or i have my own stupid questions to ask.

tl;dr at the end lol ðŸ’€

for context, i was initially aiming to go to jc. however, i did pretty badly for my o levels thus i am not eligible for jc (raw 21), and only left with mi and poly as tertiary education options. my nett l1r5 is 19 and nett l1r4 is 13. i got distinctions in english and combined science, Bs for pure geography & combined humanities and Cs for e-math, a-math and chinese.

this has made me question whether i should move on to mi & take a levels instead of poly for a diploma, which has been my intent since sec 2. my plans are to take a arts/arts-hybrid subject combi (either GELm or GEMOBm) and my current aim is to get into the big 3 unis.

if you were to ask me why i want to go to take a levels, i honestly donâ€™t have a clear answer? as of now, i am certain i will not pursue science (with the exception of maybe biological/environmental science), and that i want to study social sciences in nus chs (major in either econs, geog, psych) or smu law if my results can make it. i donâ€™t really have a career i wish to pursue in mind, but a humanities teacher is one that i keep in the back of my mind because i canâ€™t think of any other jobs in the arts & social science field in singapore that pay decently since weâ€™re so stem-based, and i find teaching kinda fun. another reason i wanna take a levels is because i really wanna study subjects like econs and geog as i really enjoy learning about the world and how it works. and i believe i have enough passion for geog to sustain me through h2 geog (or at least i hope). ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ 

if i end up going to poly, iâ€™ll probably be going to a media, business or humanities course. i previously aimed to go to np masscomm, but itâ€™s cop is 11. this has led me to look at other courses such as np abm, itb and tp cmm which have cops of 13. based on my research i will be able to admit into nus chs & major in social science with these diplomas as long as my gpa is high enough. 

my biggest concern about poly is that it's alot harder to enter uni. for the uni course i want to enter, i need a gpa of 3.7-3.8. and i'm not sure if this is true but apparently poly students need to have a good co-curricular record or diploma with merit for uni admission as compared to a levels where they look solely at rp, and that unis reserve 2/3 of its slots for a level students? can anyone confirm this? there's also the question on whether it's easier maintaining a 3.8 gpa or getting 78rp at a levels. i donâ€™t believe that poly is easier than a levels because theyâ€™re both honestly equally as stressful, but poly definetly has more work-life balance.

another concern i have with poly is that there's alot of group work. don't get me wrong it's not like i absolutely don't want group work (not like i can escape it in jc with pw or uni as a matter of fact), it's just that if i get really shitty group members i either tank or my gpa tanks. mass comm and biz don't even have written exams anymore either it's a bunch of group projects and graded assignments that collate to form my gpa. i don't know i can tahan 3 years of that because i will go insane. 


**other general questions**

**h2 lit vs h2 mob**

as for h2 lit, i honestly donâ€™t know whether or not i will enjoy the subject? i have ZERO background in lit, and i don't read books often. i have a pretty decent command of the english language but i lowkey suck at analysing or expressing what i interpret from texts so iâ€™m scared iâ€™ll suffer in lit. but at the same time idk if i'm gaslighting myself because i did get an a1 in english-? idk anymore help ðŸ˜­

as for h2 mob, i also don't have any background in this subject, but the main thing that draws me to it is that it is an mi-exclusive subject. this would mean that the bellcurve is within mi, and i would assume it means it wouldn't be hard to get at least a B in h2 mob. however, as it is an mi-exclusive subject, resources are more scarce and i can only depend on resources provided by mi, where as for other subjects like h2 lit and chem i have the holy grail and can easily buy notes from raffles from carousell etc. similarly, for h2 lit i will have to compete with smarter kids from top tier jcs when i sit for my 3h2 papers in pu3.


**travelling time/distance**

if i don't make it to np masscomm, should i go to tp cmm instead even though it takes >1h for me to travel there? or should i just take another course that i am somewhat interested in at np (which is abm)? np is only about 45 mins away but idk if it's worth travelling >1h to tp to study something that interests me more.

**possibly stupid idea**

okay bare with me... what if i enter mi in feb, and then if i realise the enviroment doesn't suit me i transfer to poly in march? is this a stupid idea, be brutally honest with me. ðŸ’€ are there any risks involved with this?

70,t3_as9y6k,"When I was in Secondary 2, I didn't think much about paying attention. I was similar to what some of you might do in class. I would place my phone under my table. (When you think about it, isn't it weird if one of your students was staring at his crotch for too long?) I would also joke with the guys close to me about anything which the teacher might have said. I sometimes would spend the whole period only chatting.

&#x200B;

When I got older, I realised how important it was to focus on lessons. Think about it, **during that one period, the teacher will teach something which he won't bring up again**. He doesn't have enough time to repeat how Electrolysis with copper electrodes work if someone doesn't concentrate as he will have to move on to teach another topic, such as organic chemistry. Even if he does, it's only for a brief moment without much guidance. During the introduction of a new topic, a teacher can spoon feed you, and that's when you must pay attention! Most subjects cannot be learned alone. You need someone who can figure out where you are wrong too.

&#x200B;

In fact, there is an alternative to learn something which you didn't pay attention in class. Consultations. **However, why would you waste extra time from recess or after school when you could've focused when you were supposed to?** Sorry if I sound irritated, but you really need to fully understand the consequences of not paying attention!

&#x200B;

So, what ways are there to better concentrate in class? Here are a few suggestions:

&#x200B;

**Choose an optimal seat**

&#x200B;

There are a few characteristics of such a seat.

&#x200B;

Firstly, it must be a seat where **the teacher can see you very clearly**. That means no more of sitting at the back of the class so you won't get caught. If possible, **sit at the front as much as possible**. You are forced to listen to everything the teacher says. I've sat right at the centre and in front of the class in Secondary 3. Though I get called out to answer quite a lot because of that, it's still great considering I wanted to pay attention. If you are tall and worried you might block your classmates behind you, then sit at the side (as everyone is focusing on the whiteboard/screen which is at the centre).

&#x200B;

Secondly, **the people you sit with must not be distractions**. Even if they are using their phones or sleeping, as long as they're not disturbing you, it's fine. It's when they talk to people or create a ruckus in class that they need to be warned. Tell them nicely that you are not concentrating well when they behave like that. If they don't change even after a few warnings, then ask the teacher for a switch of a seat. Now, can you sit with your friends? You can do so, **provided both of you are disciplined enough to not chat about something irrelevant to the lesson going on**. Bonus points if you have someone around that is academically extraordinary and is willing to teach you if you don't understand.

&#x200B;

**Go to the toilet quickly before each lesson begins**

&#x200B;

This one helped me a lot. Walking to and fro from the toilet provides some movement you'll need to stay energised after sitting in one spot for an hour. In the toilet, you could do your business so that you don't have to leave in the middle of a lesson and miss out on some important content which the rest of the class got. In addition, **refresh yourself by splashing water on your face and neck.** I GUARANTEE you won't sleep for at least the next half of the lesson. Bonus points if you drink water and then refill your water bottle after using the washroom. Drinking water when you're tired helps your lethargy. Extra bonus points if you help your classmates to refill bottles too! Demerit points if you take up too much time in the lavatory and you are late to lesson though.

&#x200B;

**Ask the teacher questions**

&#x200B;

This should be obvious enough, but for those of us who are shy, IT'S OKAY TO ASK! You're not showing that you're dumb to everyone. You're showing a keen interest in learning. No one is going to laugh at you for missing out on something which the teacher has said before. We're humans after all. Also, **what if you asked something which was on everyone's minds? You just became their saviour by raising up your hand!** We're all in school to learn, so don't be scared! If the teacher just carried on without acknowledging that you have a question, you can ask the teacher after the lesson. No problem with that. It's frustrating when a teacher assumes that his students are following his lessons when they actually aren't. It's like why couldn't you have clarified your doubts in the first place? An alternative is to question a classmate who understood what was being taught (but please ask the teacher first).

&#x200B;

**Write down notes**

This gets your body working. From the hand to the eyes, to the brain. However, you don't just copy every word the teacher is saying, as you won't really register the concepts into your head. This is a link on how to do active note-taking, which I have yet to try (but I will in JC, especially during lectures). The Cornell Method seems really promising!

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4jSlJ4Qeo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jC4jSlJ4Qeo)

&#x200B;

**Last but not least, PUT YOUR PHONE AWAY!**

Out of sight, out of mind. Find any method you can to get this device away. Confiscate it to a trusted friend or teacher, place it in your school bag, don't bring it to school, block certain applications during school hours, the list goes on. I've kept my phone away in school since Secondary 3, and it has helped me a lot! This included my classmates who did it too.

&#x200B;

Moving on, even though I seem to find consultations a waste of time, I actually find them useful. I'll tell you how they are so for the next post!

Iâ€™m aiming to go EJC Hybrid combination (so science stream cop: 6/7), which now seems impossible because of my chinese results. I donâ€™t know man. I really thought I could get an A to add into my L1R5 and now Iâ€™m really unconfident for everything. My prelims start in a few days and I have no idea how well Iâ€™m going to do. I mean Iâ€™ve been mugging a lot since June but is it enough? I worked so hard for chinese yet I got a B3..

Anyway, I started this thread so we can all discuss about our results before prelims come and talk about our worries so I feel less alone.
For secondary 3, WA1 I got raw 10, as for WA2 and WA3 I forgot what I got but I remember doing relatively well. For WA4 raw 6. (Man those good times.) However, nearing EOYs I got really burnt out and got raw 19. Entering secondary 4, I was at the worst state, struggling to pick myself back up and scored over 20 points. Then when MYE was approaching, I got a little better and got raw 13. I thought I was going to do well mentally and academically but then the chinese O level results hit. Iâ€™m afraid. I have some history of mental issues so Iâ€™m pretty weakminded. Stuff like this gets to me easily, plus I tend to compare myself with my peers easily and set high expectations for myself.. (even my parents begged me not to stress myself out)

If youâ€™ve already taken your O levels and graduated, it would be appreciated if you could leave some tips for me.

but honestly what if jc system rlly doesn't work for me ? is it still okay for me to go poly and still go med school? im spiraling rn and my grades are kinda dropping and im just struggling to pull my own weight for o levels. 

its harder for me because i cannot get tuition, i have very bad ? focusing problems and right now I'm trying to eae into biomed science in np. i dont have a back up besides entering common science programme because i never thought of anything else which is rlly stupid of me i know.

im stressing over my write ups even though its very simple and i have lots of content. i just cant get myself to start?. im struggling so much just for this and now i dont even know what to do.

for biochem and emath, i have been stuck at the a2 stage throughout the year idk why i just canâ€™t get the extra few marks to progress to an a1. personally, for emath my teacher is extremely stringent in marking hence the a2? but as for the rest, i really have no excuse. amath was an improvement so itâ€™s not really â€˜stuckâ€™ so iâ€™m mainly concerned over emath and science

that leaves my prelims L1R4 with 10 raw and 14 for raw L1R5. thing is idk if i wanna go jc or poly yet, so i need to ensure both L1r4 and L1r5 are at least below 10/11 nett to be safe. with my b4 chinese, itâ€™s already then super tough for my L1R5, so to make it more viable for me to reach my goals, the easiest way is to bump all my a2s to a1s which can never seem to go up. (if i achieve in bumping all the a2s to 1s and assuming everything else maintains, my L1R5 could jump to an 11 raw, the diff is vital imo)

and imo, my schoolâ€™s standard is not that good LOL, i donâ€™t think my school sets extremely hard papers for prelims like other schools. and instead i feel that they set realistic ones? not too easy yet not too hard and around the avg olevel standard, so i feel it is mostly an accurate estimation for oâ€™s? but then again itâ€™s my own opinion lol, idk how true it actually is.

all in all, iâ€™m not sure how to push myself and get out of that a2 mark. it seems as if itâ€™s impossible for me to get out of it even tho deep down i know i have so much more potential (carelessness costs me a lot) any advice would be appreciated! iâ€™m so close yet so far ðŸ˜­",Potential_Wolf1094,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

paper 1: 
ç”µé‚®/åšå®¢: 
- read through both kinds carefully. decide what kind could provide you a better view and stronger points. NEVER JUST CHOOSE A KIND OF ç”µé‚® BECAUSE YOU ARE BETTER AT IT. i always discourage it so badly as u never know in o level, which is better for you. it is always good to practise both, but focus on 1 type. ensure u know the format.
- (ç”µé‚®)for content, identify points from the sender (mostly coming from questions) and think if logical response could come to ur head. read through the background info to provide u insights.
- (ç”µé‚®) when at the start, ensure you é—®å¥½ and state your purpose CLEARLY. provide emotive words and elaboration of how you feel for the person at the 2nd para as that is roughly abt 2-3 marks. for suggestions at least 2, most 3 points and make sure you elaborate like HOW U EXPLAIN TO YOUR MOM U DIDN'T BUY THAT BUBBLE TEA YOUR FRIENDS BOUGHT FOR YOU. the skills 5W1H comes in and make sure you sound like YOU RLLY CARE FOR THE PERSON and make sure make sure you at the end conclude and ç¥å¥½.
- (åšå®¢) i always recommend people with strong and broad knowledge to write this. the language in this case must be very very formal and don't present your personal feelings in. åšå®¢ must answer all customers (jst remember if ur doing a job, you must make sure all customers comments and questions to be answer otherwise a report or complain æ¥ then u no job) and the points must be quite far apart. what i always do is to brainstorm various situations that can happen due the topic and then allocate the MOST EFFICIENT solution. i always take it as (BOAST MY PRODUCT LIKE GOOD GOOD) so when people praise, I will BRING IN some OTHER GOOD THINGS that are linked to the good part they praise.

ä½œæ–‡
to be short and simple... those who i reco to choose
Q3: strong emotive words and story making skills (creative.) the (1+3) are the most frequent set my classmates hold.
Q4: logical and have solid examples. also have idioms or ä¿—è¯­ that connects with the topic. 
Q5: wan to be a politician (jkjk) but the skills required i rlly think will make someone good politician. also requires strong é˜…è¯»ç†è§£èƒ½åŠ› to understand whatever is the key points to answer with. usually i put it as why>how. 

paper 2:
first 10- sorry but that is usually ur language component so rlly based on luck. oso can use something i do if u dk the word. i often observed that the words given have 1 common word in common. eg. é—ªå…‰ é—ªäº® é—ªç…§ é—ªè€€ what i always do is to look at the UNCOMMON word and see their meaning. usually would be associated with the whole è¯è¯­ but vary too. worth a try if rlly cannot interpret the word. 
ç—…å¥æ”¹æ­£: alot of the times is the 4 kinds of issue come + 1 repeat. so if u rlly can't spot and there is 1 missing kind of issue, u can try to use that. always spot for ä¸»è¯­ (ä½ ï¼Œæˆ‘ï¼Œå¥¹ï¼Œä»–), sequence of the sentence (whether weird of not, any part shift le can make it more make sense), the accuracy of the è¯è¯­ (question urself if u will use this word to represent this situation or not) and if there are missing phrases (this one oso need to question urself if u feel there are points that are written)
mcq: read the passage and question thoroughly and choose the BEST answers. MUST READ ALL OPTIONS. don't jst choose when u see 1 make sense (HCL has this issue of 4 answers are right, jst 1 is the best) so don't waste and say bye to ur precious marks there.
é˜…è¯»ç†è§£: i always read through questions first then the passage to get a hang of what they are.saying. when u finish reading both, have ur answers in the brain and question if that has fully answered the questions. once u are confident, jot it down. the tip for q17 (the interpret sentence one) is to change some of the keywords WITH context in ur ans. the ä½ è®¤ä¸ºone, apply 5W1H and give solid examples.
é•¿æ–‡ç¼©çŸ­: im not very good at this, my results like è¿‡å±±è½¦ from 3-14 so rlly need to ensure u interpret the topic correctly.

physics : lack of practice + i sacrificed studying physics to pull up my maths bc my physics was already top 20% in my sch for mid years which tested everything already anyway so i wasnt too worried 

chem : i didnt do a single damn practice paper and i procrastinated revision a lot, plus i got 15/30 for mcq so that rly pulled me down a lot. ive been mugging tys and prelim papers from other top jcs from this year and i havent gotten below a B for any of them though so i dont know if i should be worried or not. 

maths : i got S for mid years and i mugged 2022 prelim papers like mad bc my pure math was really lacking. it paid off bc i improved from 45/100 to 64/100, but then my paper 2 died so i still ended up with 55. math was my worst grade for mid years and worried me the most because i really need my minimum 87.5rp if im gonna get into dent 

econs and gp i did fine, im not too worried bc they were both high Bs which will inevitably be an A if i keep at it from now until As im sure 

if ur gonna tell me to give up dent or tell me im hopeless, please dont bother saying anything because i literally cant sleep at night when my science subjects faltered so badly. i even applied UK but i guess im giving up on that now because my predicted grades are obviously trash. 

my main issue is that idk whether i should even be worried or not because especially for chem ive been mugging after prelims and doing fine, and i know my physics was just a sacrificial lamb for prelims but the grade still scares me. math iâ€™ll just keep working at it, im fine with it being a B for A levels provided the rest are all As (i got A for pw btw) 

yeah just some advice please bc im rly freaking out, theres 30 days left to first written paper and chem prac is literally in 13 days, i dont wanna have to redo my As because i end up with 85rp and cant make it to dent anymore. this isnt a joke either btw ik some people will say im mad for aiming â€œhighâ€ but to me i need to get at least 87.5 but im still aiming for 90. i know people have gone from straight Us to straight As but i dont wanna depend on that for myself. im also scared of grade inflation because this one month is when everyone is mugging tys and me doing the same feels like im gonna end up with the same grades for A levels omfg bow im even more scared after typing that out

2nd post of the day, gosh. I have a suggested essay for this question below for General Paper.

# [Can we eliminate violence with education?](http://thediscourse.sg/general-paper-notes/essay-and-aq-answers/eliminate-violence-education/)

Click the link above for the full essay! Please don't worry about the link, it's not meant to phish or whatever.

# Question Breakdown

**Key terms and their definitions**:

\- eliminate violence: entirely get rid of violence  
\- with education: ... with the **public education system** or **education of the public**

The question makes two assumptions: **we can eliminate violence with education**, and **we can eliminate violence**.

How are they different? The first assumption already assumes that eliminating violence is a **given;** the question centers around the best way to eliminate it. (in this case, education.) The latter assumes that eliminating violence is a given, period. 

**Tackling the question**:

\- You need to assess whether education of the public AND public education systems are the best ways to eliminate violence.  
\- You need to question the idea of whether violence can even be eliminated in the first place.

# Some Tips

You need knowledge on public campaigns, grassroots movements, education syllabi, etc. Also, you need knowledge on *what causes violent tendencies in people in the first place*.

It is easy to lapse into a ""yes no yes no"" binary analysis, i.e. yes we can (Obama), no we cannot. Instead, think about the **specific ways** that education can **limit** violence, rather than addressing yes eliminate or no not at all.

This isn't a technically difficult one either. A nuanced essay should net you pretty decent marks, depending on your language.

# Essay Outline (Topic Sentences)

&#x200B;

1. Indeed, we can seemingly eliminate violence with education as it mitigates violence through imparting moral values.
2. Furthermore, education is not necessarily limited by the implementation  of moral education in public education systems. Through its  manifestations in other forms in society, it can also possibly  contribute to the elimination of violence. Such manifestations can be  seen in rehabilitation programs or non-profit social work.
3. However, to suggest that we can entirely remove violence with education  alone is erroneous, due to its limitations that prevent the immediate  mitigation of violence. Education is a process that requires a long  period of time to prove efficacious and a vast amount of resources to  implement.
4. In addition, violence is nigh impossible to eliminate as long as there  are unmanaged social tensions stemming from fault lines in the forms of  cultural and religious differences between communities of people with  their own unique identities as well as individual upbringing. When these  differences are not managed properly, it can potentially give rise to  stereotypes and discrimination that are hotbeds for violence between  communities.
5. Nevertheless, education remains the most effective method to stymie  violence. As such, to make up for its deficiencies, it must come along  with other measures such as laws and regulations underpinned by  effective governance.

I know Jc subjects are harder but the funny thing is I studied for a week straight for that test and spent most of my time on bio. Like the teacher said my phrases were wrong? Like how do I even study bio. Do I like memorise everything or what should I start memorising? In secondary school I usually didnâ€™t memorise much and just understood the stuff but still managed to do well and thought the same studying strategy could be applied to JC. But guess not.

e.g. 2

i only got the hang of how we shld prioritise which exams based of the percentage and marking schemes how to score etc in upper sec

111,t3_10d738s,"hi!! so basically im a recent a level grad who is kinda clueless on what i wanna study in uni. i would really like some help and advice ðŸ˜…

about me: in school i was good at geography & economics, but was really bad at math & found it boring. My GP and literature also aren't the best tho so i'm not artsy(?) Interests wise I am interested in cultures/psychology etc 


job wise i'm looking for a liveable income hopefully with money to pursue martial arts & travel. i don't need a car or a big house but i do want to eventually be independent and move out of my mum's house. 
i would also like a good work life balance and not have to do OT too often.
I'm also not the best with people so I definitely don't wanna go into sales/HR etc. 

so I am considering taking a degree in either psych or geography or anthropology and maybe a minor in a language (?), and then moving on to research and hopefully getting a PHD in it later on. 

i'm kinda worried however at how difficult it is to get into grad school (masters or PHD) for psych/geography/anthropology etc, 

and from what i know an arts degree alone in one of these fields are not very useful. 

I do know i hate children so I definitely don't want to become a school teacher, and i'm not too keen on social work either.

i thus am thinking whether I should just study business/finance/accountancy/international business/corporate law but i heard that the work life balance in these industries are terrible so i'm not sure if i wanna go for that. - i'm not sure how true this is tho? 

I was looking into computer science and data analytics but my math isn't the best and I don't know any coding (Technically I can start learning now but will I still be lagging behind my peers who started at a younger age)

any other degrees I should consider? ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…or any advice you would give?

112,t3_lmp7ph,"(was going to put A levels for the flair but i guess this suits rant more?)

as the title says iâ€™m going to share my thoughts on the 2 year journey iâ€™ve had in jc and taking A levels. first let me give yall some back story. i ended my sec school life with l1r5 raw 6 and went to a jc that most would would consider somewhat good. as a result of my aforementioned O lvl score, i was placed in a class of ppl with similar grades and i guess â€˜intellectual abilityâ€™ (who were thankfully all very nice) i mean ofc i knew jc was going to be tough but it really hit me like a train. in sec school i was used to cramming and being able to slide to a pass even if i didnt study much but now i was at the bottom of the class. it was the worst with math. math went from being my best and easy to score subject to the worst in my report card. didnâ€™t help that i couldnâ€™t figure out what was wrong with me. it just seemed like everytime i was put into an exam situation my brain would freeze up. anyways i tried my hardest to improve my studies but it was demoralising to see stagnant failing grades after putting in so much effort. 


i think i i started to improve at the start of j2, with me finally pulling my grades up to mostly passes. but then covid came and i started to let myself go. it became worse as circuit breaker was put into place, since i had no proper supervision and lack of control over my time. came back to school, had cts and prelims, and it seemed like everyone was improving. on the other hand, i was majorly deproving, dropping back to failing grades and even getting Us for my prelims. i didnâ€™t have anyone to turn to directly, with my friends in class worrying abt reaching that A grade while i was still trying to go pass an S. (ofc i dont mean that their worries were invalid i was trying to prove the gap btwn us) tried to tell myself that it was still salvageable, that it was the final A lvl papers that counted. so i crammed A lvl papers and got somewhat good grades? i guess but everytime i tried another schools paper i got the same dismal results again. i knew my basic were screwed up alr but i tried my best to solidy my foundation before actuals As started. 


it felt like a blink of an eye, the whole period of taking A level papers in november. it was kind of underwhelming actually. iâ€™ve been struggling for the past 1.5 smt years just for this one month to be over so quickly?? but i donâ€™t miss it and i wouldnâ€™t want to relive it again. it was a challenge to fall asleep before every paper and hearing ppl exchange answers after was even worse. i never tried checking the answers properly after any papers because i knew i wouldnâ€™t be able to take it if i found out i screwed up. the next few months, december and january, flew past as fast as november did and here we are now. february the 18th. a day before the A lvl results release date.


originally i planned to collect my results at home to avoid any possible way of embarrassing myself in front of my schoolmates and teachers. but due to some lagging issues in the singpass system during the O lvl results, i was eventually persuaded (read: forced) by my mum to go to school to collect the results. honestly iâ€™m super scared. i donâ€™t want to face the truth. i donâ€™t wanna see what lies in the report card. the past few weeks leading up to this have been a nightmare. sometimes i would have dreams of collecting my result slip and being able to see at least one A on it. oh i couldnâ€™t ever properly describe the joy i felt in my dreamscape after seeing one A. but then i would wake up and realise it was all a dream. i donâ€™t know how badly this has affected me mentally for me to be dreaming abt it unprovoked. 


tw suicidal thoughts 
besides dreams i would also contemplate ending my life if i didnâ€™t achieve desirable grades. ofc i thought abt it before during my schooling period but it intensified during As and especially after. itâ€™s like knowing you canâ€™t do anything abt it anymore and you have to be resigned to your fate m, the fate that you have landed yourself in. instead of just thinking â€˜oh kmsâ€™ it was more like detailed plans of how i was gonna end it, where i was gonna go to do it, and what i would write in my final letters to my closest ones. itâ€™s not like i havenâ€™t been dropping hints before but i also donâ€™t want to worry anyone. at that point family and friends were the ones stopping me the most from actually doing anything, as well as cowardliness, fear of pain and the possibility of surviving as a burden. itâ€™s hard to explain why i thought that this was my only way out. maybe it was because this had made me seem worthless, as if the only thing i was ever good for (academics) was stripped away from me and i would always be a disappointment. i think thatâ€™s my biggest fear. ending up as a good for nothing disappointment. i donâ€™t want to walk into school and see the looks of pity and disappointment on my teachersâ€™ faces, especially those who tried helping me the most. it makes me feel sick and useless. it would be even worse when my friends ask me abt my results casually and i hesitate to give a response. what am i supposed to do? in a room full of possible 90rpers... well i should be used to it, being the lowest in class after all. i donâ€™t even want 90rp i just want to be accepted into any uni... i used to joke with my friend that i would take any course as long as a uni would accept me haha...


also i donâ€™t want to break down in front of my friends. i think they see me as some kind of happy keeping the peace kind of person and i donâ€™t want to burden anyone with my feelings. i also feel like they couldnâ€™t understand anyways. 


anyways yea this isnâ€™t an attempt to scare ppl into not taking As or whatever but more like a rant to say out everything iâ€™ve been thinking about. also to those currently taking As this year, make sure your concepts and basics are well established, know what youâ€™re doing with your time, and donâ€™t let yourself regret that you couldâ€™ve worked harder. and jiayous to everyone else collecting results i seriously hope yall wonâ€™t feel what iâ€™m feeling rn

He literally failed his WA and she consoles and comforts him, while when I barely pass a pop quiz in class she is very sarcastic towards me. Like this is the reason why I have very few leadership roles as she will try to suppress me from getting any leadership roles as she sort of ""targets"" me and my group of friends. Furthermore, when she confiscates things from me, she will tell me to meet her after school to discuss why she confiscated that item. However, she is very late and will saunter slowly to the meeting point despite being very late. If I have other commitments on that day e.g. CCA, she will be very sarcastic and to a certain extent toxic and postpone the meetup and want me to meet her the next day. Should I have any commitments the next day, she will just say too bad. Like what can I do?  If I try to voice this out, she will be very crafty and manipulative and get her way out of the situation. This now has been affecting me for almost 1 and a half years and taking a toll on my health as I have to face sleepless nights with constant anxiety trying to predict what her next move will be.

About me:
Iâ€™m currently a part-time undergraduate, and what I study is language-related. Education is important to me, but Iâ€™ve never thought it was everything. I place human relationships over studies, and I think living is more important than a paper chase. Iâ€™ve always had a flair for languages, and I do love teaching. Iâ€™m also really good at identifying problems and correcting them, and Iâ€™m very dedicated to finding solutions.

Why Iâ€™m posting:
In our current education system, itâ€™s not easy to stay on top of everything and feel mentally â€œokayâ€. As a student your priority will be your studies, and if you are struggling, I want to help. So, lâ€™m good with languages, particularly with English, which is what Iâ€™m mainly offering to help with. English is the foundation for most things in your education track, and writing skills are essential. If you are doing well, thatâ€™s really really great, but if you are someone who is struggling, I want to help. That being said, I also want to be someone you can talk to if you are struggling in any other way, not just with school.

How I might be able to help:
- If you struggle with your English papers
- If you want help with any of your school work
- If you need someone to talk to 

Remember that getting help early is important, donâ€™t let your problems fester.

Iâ€™m really not the best, but I think Iâ€™m good. Iâ€™m also someone who puts in the time and effort with my commitments. To put in simply, I have the heart to help you. Iâ€™m putting this out here and if it can help even one person, Iâ€™ll be glad. So Iâ€™m not promising results, but I believe I will be able to be a good guide â€“ and itâ€™s FREE. You lose nothing. Take a chance on me and you could be taking chance on yourself too.

Contacting me:
I created an email just for this, itâ€™s schoolishardhelp@gmail.com and you can email me there, letting me know how I can help. Or just to talk to me about anything if you need. Itâ€™s anonymous, I donâ€™t know who you are so feel free to use it. Otherwise, drop me a message here with your telegram username and I can contact you instead.

If you need help with schoolwork, we can meet up somewhere public and go over it together, no time limit â€” Iâ€™m a patient person. If you want to do it over Zoom, thatâ€™s also okay. My priority is making the process of seeking help as comfortable as it can be.

123,t3_143cho9,"I've been contemplating whether to post this or not but I feel that this needs to be shared  


Context:  
I have a friend at Compassvale Secondary School, he is weak at Chinese but over a few years of tuition and hard work he has finally gotten to the 'just pass' standard of C6 - C5. However just before Chinese O levels he had dropped to Basic Chinese.  


What happened:  
A few months before taking the 29 May paper for O levels, my friend has been harassed by Compassvale Secondary teachers into dropping Express Chinese for Basic Chinese. The reason? Compassvale Secondary has never had a fail for Chinese O levels since the past 5 years. The teachers have used multiple techniques to convince my friend to drop O level Chinese, which I find is pretty scummy especially because they are TEACHERS, they should be supporting him, not give him more stress.  


Their form of action: After school 'talks'

For most school days, my friend would be called to the principal's office where they would tell him reasons why he should drop to Basic Chinese, with some along the lines of 'At least in Basic Chinese, you are guaranteed to get a pass. But if you take Express Chinese, there is a high chance that there will be a bad grade in your O level result sheet, which would not look good' and 'Look at our schools failure rate for Chinese, if you fail Express Chinese, you would have ruined our 5 year streak of not having any Express Chinese failures, you would become an outcast etc'. The teachers even went out to visit his house to talk with his parents about it, which I am 100% sure is not something a teacher is allowed to do. They even ask him on a daily basis whether he has made up his mind, adding even more pressure to him on top of the pressure from O levels.

&#x200B;

What happened in the end:

On the day of Chinese O levels, I was trying to search for my friend after Paper 2 had concluded. However, when I messaged him, asking where he was, he replied that he decided to drop Express Chinese and take Basic Chinese instead. His tuition teacher was not happy with this and even wanted to write in to Compassvale Secondary School, but decided not to as if he did, my friend would only have to face more harassment from the teachers.

    
Conclusion:

Honestly, I don't expect Compassvale Secondary will do anything regarding this situation, so I am going to post this to remind everyone that you SHOULD NOT let others convince you by exploiting your weaknesses, you should believe in yourself, even if you fail",MaintenanceLow902,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0

132,t3_12jmudy,"Heloo, currently a j3 student that graduated last year, class of 2022 and serving my national service. Recently was reading a few posts about j1s stating on the difficulty that they are facing in junior college and thought that I would be able to share my experience and any advice that I would give. 

For those that are aiming to get 90rp and currently not doing well, don't worry too much about your current grades, just for context, I come from a slightly above average jc and I managed to improve from 45rp during mid years, to 74rp during prelims and managed to miraculously get 90rp during my A's so don't give up! (I take BCME 4h2s for context, and ngl school exams are so much harder than A levels so don't be too dissappointed if you score badly for myes or prelims)

The first advice I would give is to learn your own studying style. Each person has their own style, doesn't mean that this person is scoring the top in the class etc, you should follow their methods. For me when i study bio, i would highlight the school notes and read the notes rather than use extra time to create my own notes, whereas for others, making their own notes give them more familiarity with the content and helps them to memorise better. For j1s, at this stage where you just passed your first WA1 etc, there is ample time for you to find your own style and it will honestly help you in the long run when studying for your future topics and A levels. 

The second advice I would give is to work smart and efficiently rather than just mugging without absorbing anything. Theoretically, if you study 15 hours at 100% efficiency rather than 20 hours at like 70% efficiency, studying 15 hours will be the more effective method. Translate this to reality, this can also mean that your extra 5 hours can be used for sleep (which all jc students need LOL) and helping you to refresh your mind, preventing burn out. If you know that you can't absorb anything if you continue studying, tell yourself to just take a break, watch a show for like 15-20 minutes, reset your head and then continue again, its honestly better than just sitting there absorbing nothing at all.

The third and final advice is to surround yourself with people that are motivated and hardworking. A lot of the times, you are shaped by the people that you are surrounded by. It is important to find people that study hard and more importantly, play hard. At the right times, do your fair share of work, put in the effort that you are supposed to put in but when it comes to periods after examinations where you know you have already gave your best, just chill out with the friends that you have worked hard with, relieve the stress and dont waste your jc life on just studying!!! (have so many friends that just studied their entire jc and really ""wasted"" their 2 years which can be q sad)

TLDR : If you already gave your best in the test, put in all the effort that you needed to and even more, even if you did not get the result that you wanted. I feel that it is important to ask yourself whether there is anything more that could be done, if no then I don't think there is a reason to be sad over anything. You gave your best and that's honestly all that matters, the results are no longer in your control. SO NO REGRETS :D BUT YA enjoy your jc life, it will be a fun and memorable experience if you make it to be, so just make as much friends as you can and don't stress over whats ahead, just do what you can in the present.",amstillsurvivin,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0

physics, i have difficulties trying to answer structured questions. i understand what the qn is asking and what is needed but i just dont seem know how to put in into words. ðŸ¤¡
im also taking o level econs and to be very honest, im still memorising and understanding everything. ive yet to familiarise myself with the questions and answers. i have no idea how econs works to be honest because ive never done econs before but i took it so it be easier for my next study progression. 

okay so yeah, i think im screwed. what do you guys think tho? do you think i can make it with that amount of time ? :/

140,t3_ov3fdr,"so the problem iâ€™ve been facing is that for the past few weeks, our school has just been shoving stacks of exam papers in our bags for us to do. especially for amath and emath where our class had to do like 2 test papers every week (each set containing p1 n p2) and expecting us to finish them all by the next week. plus we still have our phy, chem n bio papers that we had to do but it was like one paper per week. 

our logic was that if we donâ€™t do those papers, going to school would be pointless because all the teachers were simply going throught these papers and we wonâ€™t learn much if we donâ€™t attempt the questions!! ðŸ¥² this has led to us staying in school till 6pm almost every day and a constant grind,, and this has resulted in something a bit more worrying which is actually revising which i define as, making notes, properly understanding and recapping each chapter of our subjects, especially the ones from sec 3! 

though we finished the papers, itâ€™s like 2 more weeks to prelims and iâ€™ve hardly made any notes for my sec 3 content(itâ€™s something i have to do to grasp the concept) and i really regret this ðŸ˜¬ 

after prelims iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s gonna be another period of even more intense practice. iâ€™m just wondering, should i prioritise the time to do those exam papers or properly revise first?? like how do i give sufficient time and attention to the two?? i know a lot of people are facing this and i just need some sort of advice, it would be appreciated!!

141,t3_15x42kb,"Okay so im a sec 4 student taking O levels this year. Everyone around me is super motivated and mugging like their life depends on it. im srsly starting to panic bc my prelims just started and i realised that im nowhere near prepared. My school has pretty high expectations for our grades, and the average l1r5 fr the previous batches is like 9 - 10?? which is completely unrealistic for me now. My friends are all mugging like a LOT and they're really starting to prep for os, but i'm still completely unmotivated and i just feel so much anxiety over my exams and how much i need to catch up, to the point where i've started avoiding my work. My grades  (like nearly all my subjs) really just dont seem promising now and i think its way too much to catch up on in the span of 1+ months. To make it even worse, most of my friends know where they want to go after os and some alr got dsa invitations, but i'm still really lost about what i want to do after os.

on top of all that, I have an exam tomorrow that im 100% going to fail, and its pretty demoralising. For context, i havent passed a single amath test since i started taking it, and even my best grade is starting to fall, so ive been slowly losing hope and confidence that i'll get anything lower than 20 fr my l1r5.

146,t3_p0d0t3,"The ***Student Mentorship Programme*** is an initiative aiming to provide academic assistance to local students. The programme matches students in need of help in certain subjects with mentors willing to provide assistance in those subjects, taking the form of informal consultations over text or video.

This time, we are happy to announce that we are also inviting students from all Secondary and JC levels to join the programme! ðŸ¥³ If you study better in a group setting, there is also the option to join small study groups for a particular subject! ðŸ‘¯ðŸ»â€â™€ï¸ðŸ‘¯ðŸ»â€â™‚ï¸

If you are a student interested in this service or a recent graduate looking to give back to the community, we encourage you to sign up as a mentee or mentor! For our first round of matching, the dateline will be on **15 August (Sunday)**! ðŸ—“ï¸

# *FAQs:*

1. If I'm currently a mentor/mentee under Round 1/2, what should I do?

Ans: If you want to receive new mentors/mentees, please fill our sign up form again.

2. Are there any requirements to become a mentor?

Ans: As long as you're an O Level, A Level or IB graduate, you can mentor students currently studying for those exams.

3. Will lessons/consultations be online or face to face?

Ans: Lessons/consults will be conducted through online means. This could be done either via Whatsapp/Telegram or Zoom/Discord. We wouldn't want lessons to be face to face, partly due to safety reasons. 

4. How will mentees be assigned to mentors?

Ans: We will ideally try to assign each mentee to each mentor based on which school and subject(s) they need help in. Mentors will ideally be assigned to mentees from the same school they have graduated from. Otherwise, if that is not possible, mentors will then be assigned to mentees that require help in the subject(s) that they applied for.

5. How will the lessons be carried out?

Ans: Once we are done with the process of assigning mentees to their respective mentors (by 15 August or so), we will then contact you all with regards to the mentee(s) assigned to you. Thereafter, you can arrange/discuss with the mentee(s) when you all want the lesson to be (eg. Once a week) and what you all want to cover during the online lesson itself.

6. In the event that the mentee(s) stop after a while, or I am unable to continue on with this initiative, what do I do?

Ans: For mentors, we will prefer them to contact us in advance should they want to discontinue. This will give us some buffer time to reassign the affected mentee(s) to another mentor. 

However, if a mentee assigned under you discontinues, the only change is that you have fewer mentee(s) to tutor.

7. When will this initiative end?

Ans: We are currently implementing this in cycles, with the current cycle expected to end once the students take their exams. Thus most mentors should expect to commit around 3 months or so at the very most. However, a subsequent cycle will be implemented after this cycle, which will last till the end of the year once students finish their exams. If you feel that you have enjoyed the experience of mentoring students and would wish to continue, you can feel free to reapply in the next cycle!",theabsurdityisreal,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
147,t3_pr6f7o,"before you continue reading, i apologise if you are unable to understand this post or if its too wordy. there r q a bit of things going through my head rn so i find it rly hard for me to express my thoughts

tldr: everything in school is making me feel worthless and i dont know how to cope (friendships, academic results, etc.)

hello everybody, as you can tell by the title, im slowly losing hope because of everything that has been happening in school. there r many things pestering my mind but im gna list the main ones. 

ive never rly been the best when it comes to socialising, mostly because i have social anxiety. im that one quiet student in class who doesnt rly ever talk. i do have a group of friends that ive hung out with since sec 1 but whenever im with them i feel as if my presence isnt rly acknowledged, i just seem to follow them around only occasionally stating my opinions at points. the thing is however id rly like to be able to talk more. ive also rly wanted to be able to make friends with people easily. every time i step out of class during recess or lunch, i see people from other classes intermingling and hanging out with each other. it also doesnt help that everyone in my entire sch talks to one another except me so i feel rly left out. because of this, i havent rly felt the greatest. ive seen myself slowly go from being cheery and lively in sec 1 to a reserved and restrained student now. even people have said that they thought i had depression from the way i act although im not diagnosed with depression. 

apart from that, many older people have usually said to me that ""secondary school will be the best days of your life, you should appreciate this moment!"". well maybe for them and other people la but it hasnt been that way for me. people in my sch always approach other people but no one ever seems to approach me so i sometimes wonder to myself if theres a problem with me. because of this im also really insecure about myself to the point where i skip recess and lunch and stay in class so that i dont ever show myself to anyone. i rmb like back in lower sec all my cca mates were so close to each other but in sec 3 after we got hold of our leadership positions, we've drifted and ive managed to hold on to only a few friendships. im 100% sure once we step down no one will talk to each other ever. 

another thing is results. idk how easy my sch papers are but there r q a few people in my class scoring 85% and above for their overall percentages ?!?! (like how tf, but to be fair my class is one of the better ones in my level). anyways it is pretty remarkable that they are able to score so well and i congratulate them. my results are respectable(?) and ik i should also be grateful for my results but compared to these classmates i feel like im not doing well enough. we're sec 3 only so i cant even imagine what it'll be like nx year during o levels when everyone is mugging their asses off. i tried rly hard and yet i cant even score higher than them no matter what. this rly makes me doubt my abilities. like i halfway through studying i think to myself is there even a point to studying cos theyre gna score higher than me again. i also cant stand my friends sometimes. they always want to find out how much i score and even when i tell them that i dont want to compare results, they'll js try to grab my paper or try to look at my marks on the class list for signing our results. whats worse is that they usually laugh and mock at me if they find out i scored lower. they r my friends and they cld be teasing me in a ""friend"" way but i can tell they are genuinely mocking me because they usually gossip abt the results that r rly rly bad.

ik ppl usually say like ""stop comparing with others, you only need to look at your own grades."". and although theres some truth to that i feel like its not entirely correct leh. like arent national exams marked on a bellcurve. one student can get 80% but if everyone else scores 90% that 80% isnt as good anymore. so i could be scoring lets say 80% for a certain paper but because it was easy and everyone scores better, my 80% isnt worth as much. i rly want to distant myself from my toxic friends that only laugh at my results but if i do i wont have anyone to talk to anymore.

anyw js wanted to get this off my chest. i was wondering if anyone had similar experiences. if youve made it this far, thank you for reading this super lengthy post :))",throwaway398217,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

156,t3_icr8pb,"JC 1 here from an ""elite"" secondary school, l1r5 4 net and went to VJC as many seniors had also gone this exact same route and thought that I too could do it.
 
Other than the first few weeks of stress free orientation, I have never hated going to school more than ever. The school culture is a mix of bullshit and fake enthusiasm from the councillors as if to cover up the fucking stressful conditions that we students are subject to.

""Work hard, Play hard"" only applies to the top 20% of the cohort, for the rest of us, it is work, scoldings, tears and pain. I was never good at studying, and I only did well for Olevels by drilling and sheer luck. I knew JC was going to be tough, but this is not what i wanted.

Most tutors  favour only the ones that do well in their subjects , neglecting weaker students or even berating them for asking questions that they genuinely donâ€™t know, even if the question isnâ€™t very good or about a basic concept. Being a weak student without a proven studying method, everyday in school is just getting insulted and thrown around, with criticism centered around my own personality like   ""you might as well go back to secondary school"" or ""you're such a pathetic person""  when you cant answer the tutors question. In this school, your grades determine how you get treated by teachers, because ""grades=learning attitude=personality=worth as a human being ""  AND I HATE IT. 

Not going to talk about my class, as it would be too revealing, but certain toxic personalities esp this notorious ""group of 3"" make life hell as they compare everything and always make you feel like shit. 
My friend from another class also shared this same sentiment of how the IP kids ooze toxicity, and i cant agree more.   

I see my friends from secondary school having it so much better outside of this old, rotting prison with this aura of sadness and having the time, energy and the freedom to go out for lunch regularly after school. Going cafe hopping on weekends and yes they still experience stress from jc life but they have a nice learning environment, nice classmates and a community to support them.
 
I never expected my life get to this point, I thoroughly enjoyed my final years of secondary school, I was happy and now these 6 months of VJC is making me lose sight of carrying on. 

Everyday, its a constant battle to keep negative thoughts away from my mind, but recently I see fewer and fewer reasons to keep subjecting myself to this pain. 
Family is trying their best to support me in this tough time, but they can only do so much, and despite trying,  i have been conditioned to think that trying is merely not good enough. 

I dont want to be just another suicide statistic, but really whats stopping me? 

Friends? a few remaining from sec school and 0 close friends in this cutthroat environment.

Religion? Closed for 5 months and these online cell sessions do nothing.

Family? i guess it is my final stronghold, but i cant go on forever like this can i?

I guess my strongest reason is hate, because id hate to fall victim to this school.

Im sure im not alone in sharing this sentiment about the school, but what can we do?

tired, stressed, scared, but still trying.

159,t3_kvh7m6,"I've been lurking on this thread since my A Level days and some people may know my account from the various AMA threads that I've held for my course in uni last year. O Level results just came out yesterday and I've been scrolling through the various posts made by the O Level grads (congrats yallz!) and I can't help but realise one thing: 

The negative connotation with going to a normal/sub-par JC was pretty real. 

I did O Levels back in 2016 (so I'm probably an oldie at this rate help) and I didn't score fantastically well at all (raw 17, nett 15 for those who are wondering). Coming from a secondary school who constantly drilled into us that your O Level grades would make or break your life, I was definitely devastated as many of my peers did SUPER well and could go on to top JCs like RI, HCI etc etc while I didn't have much of a choice in JCs at all. 

So I ended up in a super sub-par JC (hint! it's one of the merged JCs in the West) in 2017. 

In my first few weeks there, I was so demoralised and certain that I wouldn't be able to do well in life as I had somewhat screwed up my O Levels (according to my expectations and all). The school culture was kind of sad as well as a lot of people had indeed given up on doing well and I was kinda sure that well, I was screwed for life and I could say goodbye to going to uni. 

While I indeed did struggle a lot in JC, I am glad to say that despite it all, I have managed to enter a pretty good course that I'm interested in as well and am doing pretty okay! 

Long story short, while the number on your result slip may seem like it's gonna change the rest of your life right now, it actually won't. Your determination and will to work hard and succeed is what determines your eventual path in life. 

And to those who are super keen on the JC path but can only enter the bottom few JCs, if you're truly serious about  A Levels and are willing to work hard, give those JCs a chance. Even though my JC had some of the easiest cut off points to enter, my teachers were still both extremely knowledgable and willing to help us succeed as much as they could. It was because of them that I managed to regain the confidence I had lost in myself and do somewhat better at A Levels and to now study something that I truly enjoy.",stay_day_0125,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

I swore to make this the turning point, but it never materialised. then came the study break. before the study break, I kept telling myself Iâ€™d utilise it fully to make up for all I hadnâ€™t done, but when it came, I was so stressed about cramming the 2 years worth of information into 2 weeks that I kept pushing it off nevertheless, how surprising. eventually, the papers came & went, wherein I anxiously read whatever I could the night before/the morning of the paper. a few days after the papers, I messaged my teacher about retaining, convinced that I would have to or at least wanted to, not wanting to have to turn to an unsatisfactory course. she didnâ€™t reply. I was overwrought with thoughts about retaining, about having to assimilate with a new cohort, going back to the CCA I didnâ€™t like & being introverted didnâ€™t help. the downward mental spiral into these kind of thoughts stuck with me for a while even after the papers ended, so although mine might have been an extreme case, if it could happen to me, it might happen to anyone, so juniors please donâ€™t fall into the same trap of â€œIâ€™ll do it tomorrow/next timeâ€ & start early/now so u can take it slow & easy, instead of pushing everything off as I did, eventually succumbing to my own laziness & self-denial.",disgustaed,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

so my L1R5 is 9 raw 5 net. when I first got my results I was pretty happy mainly because I qualified for my dream JC and cos I was one of the top scorers in my school. I felt proud of myself for getting a single digit score without tuition and while being from a neighbourhood school with not the best academic results. my parents were pretty happy for me too and all was good.

but the past few days I've been thinking abt how I could have done way better and how I didn't get A1 for some of the subjects I studied really hard for. after seeing ppl get 6-8 raw on reddit, I can't help but feel like my score isn't as good as I initially thought it was.I know comparison is a thief of joy and all that but still ig I'm just a lil sad I didn't do as well as I potentially could have.

177,t3_j5ch6t,"Hello Everyone!

I know everyone is currently stressed about As and some of you here might be thinking that it is impossible to jump grades following your prelims and CT2 results. I am here to tell you that is still possible at this stage.

For context: I have been getting Us all year round for all my mathematics exams and my papers are considered difficult to score in, but within the span of one month of sheer grit and effort, I have been able to do it. Not an A, a B, but whatever it is, I focus on my own growth and development. That is the first step in this process of improvement.

Next, my methods for studying math: 

Firstly, I reviewed all the topics I was weak in, and reattempted all the tutorial/self-practice questions. Review is not reading the math questions, review is attempting the lecture questions again and progressing to tutorial and practice questions. Remember, it is not how much you do, but how well you do it. Math is about applying basic concepts to complex scenarios, relook the chapters, and understand the fundamentals well. That is the crux of math. (1-2 Weeks)

Next, given that I layered my revision for math, I kept revisiting the old topics again in this span of 1-2 weeks. With that, I formed a solid base to progress from, and I attempted the prelims papers for my school. Now, at this stage, I know what those of you who feel discouraged might think. I can't do it, why attempt the math papers when I don't even understand the basics. No. Form the basics with your topical revision, and then you have to take that leap of faith. It seems difficult to progress from the first step, but trust yourself. You are often your biggest stumbling block. Have faith, you can and will do it. You managed to make it to this point, that means you have succeeded in your own ways. (1\~)

Given how prelim papers are considered difficult relative to As, what your prelims grades mean is -2 grades off from your As grade. Remember, Cambridge papers are easier than your prelims, do not be discouraged, it is still achievable at this point. Reminder, there are still four weeks. No, don't tell yourself you ONLY have four weeks. You STILL have four weeks. It can make a difference. I have seniors who jumped from S to A from prelims to As. It is not impossible.

Trust yourself, that is the first step. Even if it seems hard, trust yourself. Tell yourself everyday, you can do it. Because I know you can, you will do it. It is not too late. You just have to take the first step. All the best :)",jooliuscaesar,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
178,t3_148z0gb," 

Recently, I embarked on an internship journey at an engineering firm, but I find that my responsibilities do not align with my course of study. My tasks are more administrative in nature, rather than engineering-oriented. For the past three weeks, I've been tasked with scanning and renaming documents for their transition to a paperless system. It seems that my entire three-month tenure will be consumed by this repetitive process.

Frankly, I feel as if I've gained more practical knowledge from my final year project compared to this internship. It appears the company simply utilizes interns for these menial tasks as a cost-effective alternative to hiring part-time administrators. For example, if an administrator was paid $10 per hour for an 8.5-hour workday, that would amount to $85 a day or $1700 for a 20-day work month. In contrast, I'm compensated $600 for my internship and am still required to pay my school fees exceeding $2000.

I'm contemplating the possibility of focusing on a final year project instead of this internship. Not only do I believe I'll learn more, but it will also offer more substantial content for my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. I'm concerned that when future employers ask about my internship experience, I'll have to admit that it was limited to scanning and renaming documents.

I honestly dont know what to do anymore. Im sec3 and my eoy results were super shit. All my math and sciences getting f9 chem just pass humanities still okay but i only take elect hist and ss. Basically my L1R5 is dog shit. I know im suppose to catch up during the holidays and stuff but i just can't find the motivation to do so. Especially after having my friend help take my results slip due to the fact i couldnt attend school on the last day and her mother later seeing it and basically roasting me by saying ""if i were your friend i dont dare show face anym"" i basically from then just felt so down in the dumps. 

I'm not smart at all I'm not like those ppl in my class who just study super hard for 2 whole seeks suddenly can get A1. This whole year for the last 3 months before eoy i literally worked my ass off just for me to get lowest in Physics. I stayed back in my tuition once till like 11pm just to get 35/100 for Amath. I studied till past midnight just to literally fail both my math and get super low for both my sciences. I genuinely hate this. This whole holiday up to now I've felt 0 motivation to pick up and a pencil and start doing work. Just now, my mom nagged for me to study so i did try. I tried studying chemistry. Just seeing everything and not knowing anything having to refer to the answer key for every question makes me miserable. It's like i cant even do anything right for once. What even is the point. So now im here. Ranting. 

I know i have to start studying for O levels next year I know i have to but i dont know why i just can't bring myself to. I just lay on my bed the whole day hoping a  miracle comes down on me or something. I dont know where to start. All my friends won't help me because everything is a competition here. I mean to be fair i dont have much friends in school anyways but whatever. I really want to go to a JC but its honestly ironic with how i am right now. 

Thinking about O levels makes me even more and more depressed. Like i dont think i can handle it. Last time when i got my PSLE results i started hysterically crying in school. And i fear its going to happen again. I dont know how to even help myself. Like for math if i dont know how to do a qn and refer to the answer key and then i dont understand the ans key wtf am i supposed to do?? Just sit there and stare until the answer come falling down? My teachers in school are too fast its like they only cater to kids who are just naturally intelligent and can catch up fast. My physics teacher only ever helps those smart people and people like me need wait like 102029848282 years to even ask my query cause those super smart people take so much time asking my teacher questions till i just give up and leave the class. Its not wrong of them to do that of course. But i just dont know what to do.

I lost interest in so much things. Everytime i see people getting to indulge in their hobbies it makes me mad and jealous. Which i feel bad for but I can't help feeling that way. I want to do those too. But im stuck here having to stress over every upcoming exam ever. And now that exam is O level that if i dont get into the JC i want i dont even know what im gnna do anym. I used to watch a lot of anime and enjoy the stories and stuff but now i barely watch it. Its not me losing interest is just that i feel like if i do watch im being unproductive (as if im even productive now) and start feeling guilty and mad at myself. And when i see others caught up with the latest seasons and stuff i get angry and jealous. I genuinely dont have any idea what to do anymore. All this just because of O levels wow.

plus i think that through the jc route, i would probably have a higher chance of going to popular uni courses that are related to ICT such as nus cs, nus data sci etc. 

BUT. the issue i have is that i kinda slacked off my whole lower sec so i wasnt offered amaths for o levels. so even if i end up in jc, i dont think i can take h2 math to enter into such uni courses and ill probably be stuck with h1 and ill likely have a lower chance to get into that course. 

but i have to say that im beyond ready to work extra hard to bridge such gaps. i used to slack off last time but im not the same anymore. even if it is hard, its not impossible to learn amath before jc goes in full swing. plus since im super passionate and driven to get into a cs course, ill do anything to get into my desired course in uni. (perhaps i dont mind going overseas uni as well but priority to local cuz of how much it costs.) 

so that comes to my question. is it possible/recommended for me to go jc? even if i do, can i even have the subjs needed to get into popular cs courses? without prior amaths knowledge for o levels? one part of me is telling me to just take the risk and try because i have seen people get in without taking amath but yk i just wanna know the chances so i can take a well thought out decision. i dont mind poly cuz they allow me to really learn the basics of programming before uni but its equally as hard to enter popular uni courses as well so like fdknkmfssn

187,t3_gncin6,"Hey guys, 

I graduated from poly this year with a 3.8 gpa and did not get the course I want(NUS CS) partly due to my lack of O level Math. I realised that some of the popular courses actually looks at your O level grades eg NUS CS looks at O lvl math and law needs an A2 for English.

I'll be enlisting later this year and will likely apply for O levels as a private candidate via the ITE General Education Program with their subsidized fees and free tuition. I have a few questions: 

1. How do you study for Math/English? Spam TYS? How similar are the years?
2. Since I am taking O levels for the first time(I only did my N levels), would it be smart to take 5 subjects? Or just take the subjects I need?
3. How different is O level math from Engineering math in Poly?

so i'm taking chi o lvls in like 2 weeks and im so scared but i really don't know what to do about it. my chi teacher is really not doing anything except for probably discouraging me from actually doing more Chinese practices & being actually interested in the language. during class, he doesn't even teach anything, he just asks us to read out å¥½è¯å¥½å¥ which i guess could help in our oral for æœ—è¯» but i read a wrong word once and he trashed me for that and i got even more discouraged and really felt like crying right there in class.

other subjects i'm really scared for is my physics and both maths as well as my ss. i've pretty much memorized the entire physics topical tys so far because of how many practices i did but i still see no improvement. i understand most of the topics but i just can't get the questions right. everytime i look at a math equation, i just lose all motivation and just want to go to sleep and never wake up. no matter what i do, i just keep on making careless mistakes and will never get the questions correct. just today, my friends were talking about how they got really high for this e math quiz on trigo, and i couldn't even discuss it with them because i got 5/14 and i just felt like shit. for ss, i just do not have the capability to answer the questions. i do not possess the skills required to answer the questions, and i don't think i ever will. i've been wanting to consult my teachers, but recently the tutorial schedule just came out and i pretty much have no time for that even if my teachers have the time to meet me.

on top of that, my 2 strongest subjects, chem & bio, have been getting worse partly because i've been focusing on physics & a math a lot, but at the same time, i don't have enough time to study for those subjects. since we technically did not step down, my school is still asking the student leaders to do some shit that i don't even want to do and did not sign up for in the first place. 

anyway, even if i manage to get my academics in order, i don't even know what i want to do in the future even though i'm planning to dsa. after jc, i really don't know what i want in life at all. i feel like i would have a very hard & stressful time if i continue to do sciences but at the same time i can't do any type or arts except performing arts & i'm not even good at it either.

i also kind of want hbl to continue since for most of the subjects, we finished the syllabus already and it would just be better for me mentally if i could just stay at home & revise at my own time. i don't want to do anything anymore but at the same time i know there will be consequences for not doing anything and idk what to do anymore. i have no motivation to do anything",80sblunt,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

On the other hand, my friends that donâ€™t go for classes, that hand up their submissions late can get As, â€œwithout tryingâ€ as they say.

206,t3_r2otqs,"Hi guys.

Backstory: I screwed up my As because I'm mentally and physically drained. My grandfather passed away after Chem P2 and honestly it took a toll on my revision. As the eldest daughter in my family, I had to participate in rituals late at night and to guide relatives, neighbours and friends. My parents actually allowed me to study at home, but I felt that I will regret for the rest of my life for not sending my grandfather away for the one last time, so I went and participated in all the rituals. I was tired and sad at the same time. I couldn't focus on my revision and kept folding the hells money to distract myself. I thought I could still do decently but I was wrong, I screwed up my subsequent papers after the first week, probably because I was so drained and burnt out. I couldn't piece the information presented infront of me and it snowballed from the start of second week onwards. Until today, I realized how bad I have been scoring... Chem MCQ 11/29...This is the lowest I have ever gotten in my 2 years. I realized I have to retake, the fact that I want to take CS/BA in any local unis.

Question: I am considering working full time (9am-6pm) next year and study for As at the same time. My family is financially drained from the cost of funeral+hospital fees as there weren't much money donated (because of covid thus low attendance rate). I want to know if it is possible to get good grades for As while working, and is retaking As privately as scary as it is? I can't retain because I'm pretty sure Im neither here nor there. I am alone and afraid... please encourage and advice me on what to expect when retaking As privately

more info: mid-tier JC/female/prefer retaking and taking a gap year so that I can help my parents financially by being financially dependent while letting them to recover slowly

Edit: I am so grateful and thankful for the help and advice given to me. It feels like another family I didn't know I needed.

OVERVIEW OF THE IBDP

If you donâ€™t know what the IBDP is, itâ€™s an alternative to the Singapore A Levels, with a common curriculum throughout the world. Students are required to take 6 academic subjects, 3 at Higher Level (HL) and 3 at Standard Level (SL). 

Aside from the 6 academic subjects, We also have the extended essay (EE), a 4,000 word mini-dissertation on a research question (RQ) of your choice, and the Theory of Knowledge (TOK), a discount-epistemology subject. Both subjects are graded without an exam; you submit essays at the end of the programme to be graded by external markers.

If you want to know more about the IBDP, you can find out more [on Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/IB_Diploma_Programme).

MY ACADEMIC PROFILE

I was from the SJI O Level programme and entered through JAE. I took History, English Language and Literature and Economics at HL and Chinese, Math and Chemistry at SL.

I'm the only child in my family and extended family who is going through jc > uni route while all my cousins went through poly route with one of them going to a priv uni so I don't really have anyone to talk to or give me advice.

So far for my A level journey, I have absolutely no idea how to feel about the papers. I felt that this year's math and chem papers were out of the ordinary? No amount of practice could ever get me ready for these 2 subject papers. I also felt like I didn't do well for my math and econs especially, now chem is on board. I kept trying to calculate my RP every now and then and worrying myself by seeing I might get a low 60. 

Now this brings me to my question, what should I do? I have 2 scenarios

\- Assuming there is a miracle and I got like idk 70 rp+  (80rp+ is a little too far for me considering I was a double U for H2s and U for my H1 in prelim, I have no confidence that my papers were in A/B quality). I would probably go for **local university courses that I am eligible for**

\- Assuming I got probably less than 70 rp, I am considering going to **private university**. I don't mind private university. There is a lot of options. The only problem I am worried about is private Uni fees. I know it's not cheap. I feel like that will burden my parents especially my mum because she's so uptight about finances. I have told her that I will be responsible for it and probably take a bank loan and pay it back when I work. Honestly, this is the most suitable option I can do coming from a low-mid income family (unless there are other options so I need opinions) . And I don't want to retake As (painful and draining) and also go poly (I don't wanna waste my time)

Here is the thing, I have always had a MAJOR interest in studying animals. I was so interested in studying life sciences. I even set it as a goal and put it on my home screen to remind myself what I'm studying for. I feel like I wasn't studying enough during my study break. I just feel and know I won't ever get into life sciences ever again because 1) the difficulty of this year's papers 2) i feel like i severely underperformed for my papers.

I know if I cannot go for a science course anymore then maybe social science course like psychology or maybe NUS nursing. But if all else fails, I'll just go to a private university. I feel like I might post another post about this when I get my results.

Recently, I took part in the singapore junior bio olympiad. Got my results today and i got an honourable mention. 

 â€Ž  

I just feel this overwhelming sense of anger, disappointment and ironically, i just feel empty. Bio is my favourite topic, and I just love it so much. So much so I spent my entire June holidays mugging the A level syllabus just to have an attempt at doing well for the bio olympiad. And what pisses me off even more is that some other guy in my class who literally did not study for the olympiad AT ALL, got a gold. Like what the hell??? I was just filled with confusion and even now, I can't collect my thoughts. Another person in my class who usually struggles at biology got a bronze. Seriously, he did better than me. The guy who can't do bio and who wanted me to share my answers for the olympiad DID BETTER THAN ME. Another one of my classmates who I kind of cross referred with for studying for sjbo got a silver. And I was there knowing my knowledge is way more in depth than me. (I know it sounds extremely narcissistic that im knocking my classmates like that, and i know, i should be congratulating them.)

 â€Ž  

And I am just devastated my this. Some of my classmates were expecting me to get a gold. My teacher, when announcing the results, tried playing it off my saying ""I dont know, maybe honourable mention is more than gold?"". She knows i can do well. I constantly get A1's for my bio and even for SA1, I topped the class and probably the cohort.

So i really just dont dont understand, WHY IS IT LIKE THIS???? I know for a fact that I can do well for the O Level and A level sections of the olympiad, SO WHY THE HELL DID THE MAN WHO CAN'T MASTER O LEVEL SYLLABUS DO BETTER THAN ME?? I put in so much more hard work than the guy who games everyday, and HE GETS A GOLD? I HAVE A REPUTATION OF DOING WELL, AND THIS????

 â€Ž  

Im just at a loss. I dont know what to feel. I said to my friends that I had a quadratic graph for my grades and i think its really showing. (I said my L1R5 8 during ca1 was my peak, since my prelim 1 L1R5 was 9). Now, I really feel its all downward - starting from my prelim, now this, I dont see myself doing well for prelim 2 and o levels. And it just...kills me. I always dreamt of going to medical school since i was 8 (sounds fake i know), and that meant going to a top jc but now, I just dont see that any more. I know and I do have a backup plan in nursing, but  there will always be just that sting that I could never live up to what I wanted to be. Because im just no better than average.

 â€Ž  

All my life, Id always been the better few. Constantly doing one of the best in pri sch and top 15% in secondary school. Im literally known as one of the mugger few in my class. To be greeted by this, it just freaking substantiates the thing ive been feeling quite frequently these days that im no better than just the average, that im just no one. My friends tell me o level is all that matters!!! But this was a chance to prove to myself that I could be a high riser now, and I just proved myself oh so wrong. No scholarship is going to want the top 40%, no medical school is going to want the normal guy, no freaking jc is going to want a shitty 40% to take h3 bio and im really trying to build my portfolio here, but im just proving myself to be just....ordinary. All my hope and dreams just feel crushed.

 â€Ž  

You know, i tried making excuses. I thought my teacher had read the excel sheet wrongly from her computer because there may be a lot of rows. So i read it myself. My name was right on top of the gold guy who didnt study. Part of me still wants to believe something went wrong. Maybe the bio teacher in my school copy pasted the results wrongly. Maybe my login code was all wrong and i did my paper under his name. Maybe, just maybe.

 â€Ž  

I dont know what the point of this is any more. Studying so hard for nothing. My interest in studying is just gone. I'm not sure what im doing here anymore. I was 8 and wanted to help people and save lives,  become a surgeon, but im just your nameless ordinary office worker.

224,t3_q95z48,"Why CCA is extremely useful in poly despite popular belief:

First, school opportunities. Who doesnâ€™t like going overseas or joining school events that gives you 1 credit to skip your general modules! Scholarships, special programmes, overseas programmes all need excellent CCA record to give you the best chance at succeeding and living your a good life as a poly student.


Secondly, it can be a backup if youâ€™re that close to getting into your University course .  Everyone should believe that they can make it into University with enough time and effort. However, life may throw you around a curve (or a bell curve) and you may be justtt a few points away from the cut off. Canâ€™t direct entry? With a good portfolio, you may succeed in your ABA! It may also help in your appeal.

Internship/ work interview: Internship or final year project. you donâ€™t get to chooseâ€¦ or do you? Companies interview students and choose, so a good portfolio definitely helps. Remember, grades land you the interview, but your portfolio and personality lands you the job.

  
Now, for any CCA iâ€™ll suggest leadership roles or a role thatâ€™s directly or very relevant to your aspiration in life. To balance CCA and your grades, I believe GPA is always first but CCAs leads to more opportunities and greater chances. Take Low commitment CCAs!

  
My suggestions:  

YEAR 1
* Do not join student relations cca or sports cca. Takes up a lot of time and usually the points given are not worth it
* Join all the CCAs youâ€™re interested in Year 1 (most time to spare) I recommend 3-5 CCAs, with the assumption that the commitment level is low at 1-3 times per month (ask them!)
* leadership roles: Look for undervalued clubs thatâ€™s not very popular that youâ€™re interested in. Very easy to get leadership role. Youâ€™ll get the role half a year after you join when youâ€™re in Y1 semester 2
* only apply for leadership roles for CCAs youâ€™re sure you want to keep

YEAR 2
* what I consider high commitment: 1 or more meetings per week. Low commitment: 1-3 meetings per week
* filter out CCAs that you donâ€™t really like (especially non-leadership roles)
* I reccomend keeping 2 CCAs to stand out and use for portfolio. These 2 CCAs can have leadership roles for CCA points
* having an excellent CCA record usually needs a leadership role so apply for at least one
* Drop CCAs if itâ€™s affecting your grades or you find out it takes too much time (e.g. found out student relations was AT LEAST 2 days a week meetings and when the event nears, it became everyday meetings even during holiday. Only got one measly service point for more than 30+ hours of commitment. Seniors donâ€™t care and will drag informal meetings to from 10pm to 2am in the morning.
* Manage your time well and you can do it (Iâ€™m in a intense business course but was still able to handle a few CCAs)
* Main point for it not to affect studies but still stand out: 2 LOW COMMITMENT CCAs, at least 1 leadership role
* Do not sign up for all events/ programmes/ projects in year 2, sign up for 1-2 max per CCA (2-4 total for 2 CCAs) while doing your assigned duties. Commitment may increase to 1-2 meetings per month or weekly meetings based on your CCA. You may want to reconsider the leadership position if it is weekly meetings

YEAR 3:
* You have tons of CCA experience and use it fully!
* should have juniors taking up your roles so lesser or no more things to do

Maximise your portfolio and time by having 2 CCAs but only utilising 4-6 days a month with the rest for studying. CCA meetings usually stop at exam and project periods or excuse yourself from meetings if youâ€™re rushing to meet important deadlines and meetings havenâ€™t stopped (donâ€™t make it a habit!)

I took the past Literature syllabus so sorry, I won't be able to provide much help for set text. But I think my unseen is still pretty good (for O levels, not for JC LMAO) and I'm aware that it's a problem for a lot of people especially when trying to close read and analyze on the spot.

For Elective History, closer to O levels, I decided to specialise in book 3 (Cold War) for the essay. I also have a few notes and practice essays I did for Cold War. I was fairly good at essay writing, so I can offer some help here too!

Additionally, I was rather good at English but honestly I just read a lot HAHA I don't really know how to give advice but feel free to ask questions for English if you need! Just be warned that my advice won't really be that detailed heh

i did once appeal for my o levels and didnt get a change in grade, let alone a thorough review and they just left. remark. thus, im skeptical to waste another $112 to appeal for my pw results. if i got a B, id probably be upset but i wont appeal. but in view of how i got a C, i would be so grateful for a B. chances of getting a B to an A is small but has anyone got from a C to a B? i understand from most schools, some might wonder why i got a C and if i messed up my OP or something, but the answer is no. i dont think i messed up at all infact, maybe abit of mistakes that are minor but not that deserving of a C. i received the same grades as many slackers who i know of that didnt even have a speech and just went in and yolo-ed the whole OP, but before yall say its WR some of my groupmates do hv a higher grade than me. also, i am not a slacker and trust me i tried so hard for pw and hence ive spend the last few days crying over my results and not being able to get over it. before this i did think of not getting an appeal no matter what as i did not want to waste anymore money  but at this rate im kind of desperate as i feel like i didnt even deserve a C and many people agree. so please dont bash me saying insensitive shit or wtvr because im just someone who just keeps some hope and if anyone has ever gotten a change of grades id just want to try my luck

thank you

edit: do note im from yijc which has around 65% of Cs and just because it is stereotyped (im guessing) that those who receive grades below B is a slacker, it does not mean i am a slacker. in fact at least 40% of people i know who got a C definitely did not deserve a C and they really put in their blood sweat and tears into pw in whole.

239,t3_ut7bpe,"So Iâ€™ve been ruminating on why Singaporeâ€™s education system is known as the best in the world, ever since sec sch, and from a studentâ€™s perspective, I think itâ€™s undeserving of such a title. Firstly, is the edu system truly based on meritocracy? Income inequality exists in our society and something like that is hard to completely resolve, but it affects many students in a kiasu society like SG. Students from more wealthy backgrounds are signed up for tuitions for almost every subject, being ahead of their peers who come from less privileged backgrounds and canâ€™t get that head start. The gov does provide assistance but they can only do so much, the wealthier families will still keep having the head start benefit. Also, academics matter a lot for one to climb up the social ladder, and since Singapore edu system emphasises greatly on grades, those who have head starts and naturally higher chances to do better, will get the better grades and climb the social ladder which reduces positions in higher institutes of learning for those who did not have the additional mummy daddy credit card to get them tuition and help improve their grades. How do they climb the social ladder like this? Based on effort. But in a cut throat society like SG, only effort isnâ€™t enough, since most people are already putting in effort, it doesnâ€™t give as big a boost as external help will. (Compare a student who has 4 tuitions and puts 100 effort and one who has 0 tuition and puts 100 effort.)  alot of people argue that tuition is useless, but seriously though, most of the time it isnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve seen peopleâ€™s grades climb when they got tuitions. I think this may be a reason why China banned tuitions, because it isnâ€™t fair for the wealthy to get a head start in academics in an academics-focused system and get even wealthier. Secondly, besides excelling in grades, many local Us want students who have months of volunteering experience, and who have participated in olympiads or hold some kind of cca or class position. This isnâ€™t feasible for most because the academic chunk already sucks the life out of them (esp in JC), to have to juggle with volunteering and position responsibilities is just too much. Another thing that isnâ€™t fair is limited positions and always the â€œmore popular/loudâ€ ones that get them. There are some people who just hold so many positions and reduce othersâ€™ opportunities. They may not even be doing their role properly, but they still hold the position because of their social status, not their ownership and responsibility in that role. I thought of something which is to let people with lower rank points eg 83.5 get into a course at a lower cut off if their household income isnâ€™t that high and set the bar for the same course higher for those who have higher household income. Thirdly, the education system has groomed us to be a cold competitive society where one is happy for anotherâ€™s pain. We already start preparing to have PSLE at the young age of 12 when the kids are supposed to be having fun and not crying over exam grades. At that age there are also child prodigies and late bloomers. Most kids donâ€™t have the maturity and patience to mug for hours, as they are playing, as kids should be. And when they do worse than prodigies groomed by parents who restrict play time and send for tuitions, society already sees those prodigies as more â€œeliteâ€œ. They go to elite schs, and rejoice at being better than their peers. I collected my sisterâ€™s psle results with her, and she didnt do so well. A peer told their mother â€œmummy I did better than x(my sister), are you proud of me?â€ It got me thinking, Singaporeâ€™s education system is so grade based leading to comparison by parents which causes us to unconsciously rejoice at othersâ€™ failure because it makes us â€œbetterâ€. Are students truly happy in this society? Reminds me of the RV incident, are students mental health being cared for? Weâ€™re not strawberry generation, the times have changed, syllabuses are getting harder from the past, donâ€™t shut us up when we are asking for help. I had a friend who was suicidal because of her grades, and many other students I know enjoy dark, suicidal jokes. Some who actually WANT to fall sick to get a break from school. My classmate got covid and he said it was a good break from sch. If students are actually wanting to be SICK to avoid having to go to sch, doesnâ€™t that say something about how suffocating and flawed our education system is? It doesnâ€™t truly aim to educate students, it aims to make them robots, stuff info in their heads, make them vomit it on exam paper, and use vomited stuff that the students literally forget the next day to preserve the undeserved title of best education system.",idontknowanymorw,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

I've seen some advice to watch Chinese drama or media, but thats really time consuming and I couldn't understand what they were saying anyway the times I tried it and just tuned out automatically. I've tried going to a Chinese church and doing practice papers too

So does anyone know how to pass hcl?",Tasty-Supermarket-23,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Iâ€™ve been doing my chinese TYS these few days, and i honestly feel super underprepared for it, especially in the compre section. 

I get that we can always re try for Oâ€™s for chinese, but i want to clear my May paper, so i can focus on my other subs. 

I feel pretty burnt out already, and i feel so scared, like what if i donâ€™t do well enough? what if i donâ€™t get a good grade? 

Can someone please give me tips on studying chinese? or just any tips on scoring well for Oâ€™s :)",supahtzsg,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had made no effort in trying to improve my handwriting over the last few years but I'm scared that the examiners might not be able to read my handwriting as I feel that it has deteriorated to the point where it is barely readable.  I've tried using thicker pens, gripping my pen more tightly etc but I can't seem to improve it. Does anyone have tips on how to write neater? Thanks!",h4v0K_9935,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
247,t3_v09rhl,"Tomorrow is my O level mt exam and I'm abit stressed. I don't plan on using Chinese as part of my l1r5 but I also don't want to completely give up on tmrs exam in case I can get >b3. For paper 1, I usually write q1 and 4 but can only score ~10-13 and 24-28 respectively. Other than elaboration on my points and using examples and ä¿—è¯è¯´(for q4), what else can I do to try and get higher marks? For paper 2, I don't usually do very well. My ç»¼åˆå¤©ç©º is absolute shit and my mcq and oeq are entirely dependent on how well I can understand the passages and how much I can lift from them. I've memorised some words that usually appear in past year papers as well as words I can use to describe people but I'm not confident it's enough to help me get better marks. Is there anything I can do to score better? 

I've been preparing for the exam the past few days but I don't think what I've done is enough. Personally, I don't think I can do this but I'm fine with trying my best and getting a grade that might not be satisfactory to me. But my mom and tutor has faith in me (my tutors words from our last session tgth was æˆ‘ç›¸ä¿¡ä½ å¯ä»¥åšåˆ°çš„ and I was so touched I wanted to cry but also so scared cause idk if I can't produce the results they want) and I don't want to let them down. 

Thanks in advance if u responded and atb for my fellow cohort mates that are taking their respective mt exams tmr or on tues :)",SpecialAppointment37,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
248,t3_dpetru,"Man really I really really just want to drop everything, the exams went bad but not too bad but shit im so so fucking disappointed in myself cause I could have done better during the exam itself. Am (I lost abt 30?m confirm)  shit I differentiated instead of integrating for area under graph and i was so happy cause I normally cannot do those ques and later after the exam I realised. Chem hell I was kinda sleepy during the first half of the paper so I was rushing for the later half. Left abt 6m? blank (QA and the redox ques) I couldn't get the eqn so my redox ans (3m) gone even tho I could do it fuck Eng hahhaahahaahahaahhah I could tell the essay was one of my worse ones. At this pt my A1s are like 'wheeeeeeeeeee flyyyyyyyy awayyyyyyyyy' and hell I do so much???? (Chem tys until fucking 2012/2011) (Am until 2010?)  and its more frustrating cause I know I have done enough before the exams and I could done better during the exams itself

My sleep has been so bad and this has been going on since the start of the year and hell people are like pls get at least 4 hrs of sleep and I'm just here like lol the fuck I sleep for 9 hrs (12-9) on weekends I feel like I only slept for 5 and my eyes are burning. and oh my god srsly I really want to just drop everything Also things at home has been kinda confusing, My friends told me that my mom is emotionally abusive (altho I dnt think so even if she is I think its fine??? cause she's a single mom so she's supporting me alone she has her own stress and I do have a comfortable life financially), but she has really been improving but at the same time whatever she did/said hasn't been erased and I don't know what to feel or do

Whoever who actually read until the end thank you so much lol I just needed to vent shit Im so angry at myself lol",wereyena,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
249,t3_10v4365,"Hello Iâ€™m planning on taking H2 Chem and maths but Iâ€™m unsure whether I should take it with h2 physics and h1 Econs or the other way around. I think most of the courses I have shown an interest in for university doesnâ€™t really require h2 physics as the prerequisite are h2 chem and either h2 physics,maths or bio. 

So I guess I should choose based on which is easier to do well in as my h2. Is physics or Econs easier? Can you share your experience with the subject?
