## Abstract
Fairness in academic assessment plays a crucial role in shaping students' learning experiences and educational outcomes. This study aims to discover students' perception of fairness in assessment using data analysis and network analysis of Reddit discussions. Through network analysis, we discovered distinct emotional patterns across assessment types to reveal their fairness perception. Our findings provide insights into students' emotional responses to different types of assessments, with implications for educational policy and fairness in evaluation.
