My exams went smoothly but my friend had screwed up. During our Science practicals, he accidentally left the last 2 pages blank.He only realised in the last second when the examiner said 'put down your pens'. In a last ditch effort, he tried to write alittle bit more. He wasnt called out and left the lab peacefully. We now jokingly talk abt it occasionally. But now that i think I about it, what were the Possible Punishments my friend could have gotten If he had been called out.
